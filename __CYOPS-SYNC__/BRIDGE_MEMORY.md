# Bridge Memory Report

## Verification Report — What I Read and What It Means

**Documents parsed (on disk):**

* `alignment-report.md` — Confirms foundation ≈95% complete (SoT/rubric/wrappers/PM2 freeze); **executor remains the gating item**; drift marked "MODERATE"; near-term priority is the **live executor** and **health/Slack** endpoints.

**Key findings from alignment-report.md:**

**✅ COMPLETED (95% foundation):**
- SoT execution contract and rubric (100%)
- File spool ingress system (100%) 
- Queue hygiene and SLA monitoring (100%)
- Non-blocking infrastructure (100%)
- Documentation (90%)

**❌ MISSING (execution automation):**
- Live executor service (0%)
- Real-time processing (0%) 
- Slack integration (0%)
- Dashboard health endpoint (0%)

**Current drift:** Focus shifted from executor implementation to hygiene/monitoring. System is functional but not fully automated.

**Immediate priority:** Live executor service implementation to achieve 85% completion.

**Reconciled picture (today):**

* SoT contract + rubric are authoritative and present; **use them by reference** (no boilerplate duplication).
* Non-blocking wrappers + PM2 freeze/fence model are established.
* Ingest/file-spool + queue hygiene exist and have been exercised in patches.
* **Executor is still the blocker** to call the pipeline "autonomous" — the implementation doc exists, but live deployment + E2E validation are not yet asserted as green.
* Slack ingest remains a secondary repair; HTTP inbox fallback should be the default ingestion path until Slack is verified.
