# Bridge Memory Pack

**Purpose**: SoT-backed memory bridge for autonomous patch execution
**SoT Location**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/__SoT__/` (linked)
**Status**: Read `STATUS_ROLLUP.json` for current system state

## Next Actions (Priority Order):
1. **Executor Deploy**: Live executor service implementation
2. **Health Endpoint**: Dashboard health monitoring
3. **Smokes**: Dual-domain smoke test validation

## Usage:
- Reference SoT by absolute path (no duplication)
- Use templates for patch authoring
- Check guards before execution
- Foundation 95% complete, executor validation needed

## Linked Files:
- SoT files are symbolic links to source project
- Ops files are symbolic links to live configs
- Bridge files reference actual G2O scripts
