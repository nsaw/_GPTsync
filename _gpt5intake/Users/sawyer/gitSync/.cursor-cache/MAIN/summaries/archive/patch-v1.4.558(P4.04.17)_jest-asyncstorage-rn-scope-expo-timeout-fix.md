# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.558(P4.04.17)_jest-asyncstorage-rn-scope-expo-timeout-fix

**Patch ID:** patch-v1.4.558(P4.04.17)_jest-asyncstorage-rn-scope-expo-timeout-fix  
**Target:** BRAUN  
**Status:** PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL  
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-29 UTC  

## Description
Mock AsyncStorage & tighten RN transform to end Jest scope errors; restart Expo with longer warm-up so /status finally answers.

## Execution Results

### ✅ Successfully Applied
- **AsyncStorage mock added**: Created mock for `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` in `jest.config.cjs`
- **AsyncStorage mock file created**: Created `/jest/__mocks__/async-storage.js` with stub functions
- **React Native transform widened**: Updated `transformIgnorePatterns` to include `@react-navigation`
- **Jest configuration updated**: Added AsyncStorage module mapper to resolve module resolution issues
- **ESLint still working**: ESLint continues to work with 959 problems (210 errors, 749 warnings) but no OOM
- **TypeScript compilation**: Works with 245 errors but completes without memory issues
- **Validation checks**: Confirm AsyncStorage mock presence in Jest config and mock file existence

### ❌ Issues Encountered
- **Jest import scope errors persist**: Tests still fail with "You are trying to `import` a file outside of the scope of the test code"
- **PerformanceMonitor timer leaks**: Jest environment teardown issues with lingering timers
- **Expo health check fails**: Expo dev-client still not responding on port 8081 after 3-minute timeout
- **React Native module resolution**: Still having issues with React Native ESM imports despite transform patterns

## Technical Details

### Jest Configuration Changes
- Added `'^@react-native-async-storage/async-storage$': '<rootDir>/jest/__mocks__/async-storage.js'` to `moduleNameMapper`
- Updated `transformIgnorePatterns` to include `@react-navigation`
- AsyncStorage mock provides stub functions for `setItem`, `getItem`, `removeItem`, and `clear`

### Expo Startup Attempt
- Used `EXPO_USE_DEV_SERVER=1` flag
- Started with `--dev-client` flag
- Extended timeout to 240 seconds (4 minutes)
- Added 120-second sleep for warm-up
- Implemented 12-attempt retry loop with 15-second intervals

### Validation Results
- ✅ AsyncStorage mock configuration found in Jest config
- ✅ AsyncStorage mock file exists
- ❌ Expo health check failed (no response on port 8081)

## Next Steps
1. **Address Jest scope errors**: Need to investigate why import scope errors persist despite configuration changes
2. **Fix PerformanceMonitor timers**: Resolve timer cleanup issues in Jest environment
3. **Expo startup investigation**: Determine why Expo dev-client is not starting properly
4. **React Native module resolution**: Further investigate ESM import issues

## Status
**PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL** - AsyncStorage mocking implemented successfully, but Jest scope errors and Expo startup issues remain unresolved.
