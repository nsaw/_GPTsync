# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.230(P0.2.13)_multi-slot-injection-parallel-grid

## Patch Information
- **Patch ID**: patch-v1.4.230(P0.2.13)_multi-slot-injection-parallel-grid
- **Phase**: P0.2.13 (Phase 0 - Foundation)
- **Description**: Injects and renders multiple slot tiles in parallel inside SlotGrid using SlotRouter with slot type pipeline.
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

## Implementation Details
The patch successfully extends the slot routing system to handle multiple slot types in parallel:

### Key Changes
- **Multi-Slot Array**: Defined `slotTypes` array with three slot types: `['DASHBOARD_ENTRY', 'TASKS_ENTRY', 'AI_TOOLS_ENTRY']`
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses `map()` to process all slot types simultaneously
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Renders all hydrated slots in parallel using `React.Fragment` with proper keys

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
const slotTypes = ['DASHBOARD_ENTRY', 'TASKS_ENTRY', 'AI_TOOLS_ENTRY'];

const hydratedSlots = slotTypes.map(type => {
  const injected = injectSlot(type, slotMode);
  const hydrated = hydrateSlot(injected);
  return hydrated;
});
```

## Slot Pipeline Flow
1. **Injection**: Each slot type is injected with current mode (mock/live)
2. **Hydration**: Injected slots are hydrated with visual indicators
3. **Routing**: Each hydrated slot is routed to appropriate component via SlotRouter
4. **Rendering**: All components are rendered in parallel within the grid

## Expected Runtime Behavior
When the app runs, the following logs should appear:
- `[SlotBridge] Injecting slot: DASHBOARD_ENTRY`
- `[SlotBridge] Injecting slot: TASKS_ENTRY`
- `[SlotBridge] Injecting slot: AI_TOOLS_ENTRY`
- `[SlotRouter] Resolving slot: MOCK_DASHBOARD_ENTRY`
- `[SlotRouter] Resolving slot: MOCK_TASKS_ENTRY`
- `[SlotRouter] Resolving slot: MOCK_AI_TOOLS_ENTRY`

## Validation Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ ESLint validation: No warnings or errors
- ✅ Runtime validation: Script executed successfully
- ✅ Multi-slot injection: All three slot types processed
- ✅ Parallel rendering: Components rendered simultaneously

## Files Modified
- `src-nextgen/components/SlotGrid.tsx` (updated to support multi-slot injection)

## Component Mapping
- `MOCK_DASHBOARD_ENTRY` → `ThoughtmarkCard`
- `MOCK_TASKS_ENTRY` → `TaskCard`
- `MOCK_AI_TOOLS_ENTRY` → `AIToolsCard`

## Next Steps
The multi-slot injection system is now functional and ready for Phase 0.2.14 development. The system can be extended to support:
- Additional slot types
- Dynamic slot configuration
- Live mode slot switching
- Performance optimization for larger slot arrays
