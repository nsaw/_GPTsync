### Patch 2: AllBinsScreen Migration
**Status**: ✅ ALREADY EXISTS (More Advanced)

#### Analysis
- **Existing Implementation**: AllBinsScreen already exists and is more comprehensive than patch requirements
- **Location**: `mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen/screens/content/AllBinsScreen.tsx`
- **Features**: Advanced bin management with collaboration, privacy controls, performance monitoring
- **useBins Hook**: Already exists with full CRUD operations, security validation, performance monitoring

#### Decision
- **Action**: No changes needed - existing implementation exceeds patch requirements
- **Reason**: Current implementation is more robust and feature-complete than what the patch was trying to create
