# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.552(P4.04.11)_jest-devmenu-turbomodule-fix

**Patch ID:** patch-v1.4.552(P4.04.11)_jest-devmenu-turbomodule-fix  
**Target:** BRAUN  
**Status:** PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL  
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-29 UTC  

## Description
Stub TurboModuleRegistry DevMenu for Jest and start Expo in offline mode to restore health-check.

## Execution Results

### ✅ Successfully Applied
- **TurboModuleRegistry stub**: Added mock for `react-native/Libraries/TurboModule/TurboModuleRegistry` in `jest.setup.js`
- **Jest initialization fixed**: Jest tests now initialize without DevMenu TurboModule crashes
- **Test timeout increased**: Increased Jest timeout from 30s to 45s for slower initialization
- **ESLint still working**: ESLint continues to work with 959 problems (210 errors, 749 warnings)
- **TypeScript compilation**: Works with 245 errors but completes without memory issues
- **Validation checks**: Confirm TurboModuleRegistry mock presence

### ❌ Issues Encountered
- **Jest cleanup issues**: Tests run but have cleanup problems with PerformanceMonitor timeouts
- **Expo offline start failed**: Expo server not starting in offline mode on port 8081
- **PerformanceMonitor errors**: Jest environment torn down errors from PerformanceMonitor timeouts
- **React Native OS property**: PerformanceMonitor trying to access undefined OS property

## Technical Details

### Jest Configuration Changes
- **TurboModuleRegistry mock**: Added stub for DevMenu TurboModule:
  ```javascript
  jest.mock('react-native/Libraries/TurboModule/TurboModuleRegistry', () => ({
    getEnforcing: () => ({}),
    get: () => ({})
  }));
  ```
- **Test timeout**: Increased from 30s to 45s in `jest.config.js`
- **Jest setup simplified**: Removed complex React Native spreading that caused DevMenu issues

### Jest Test Results
- **28 test suites**: All now initialize successfully (no more DevMenu crashes)
- **Test execution**: Tests run but have cleanup issues with async operations
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Causing Jest environment torn down errors due to timeouts

### Memory Management
- **ESLint**: Still working with 4GB allocation
- **TypeScript**: Working with 8GB allocation  
- **Jest**: Working with 8GB allocation
- **No OOM errors**: All tools complete without memory issues

## Next Steps
1. **Fix PerformanceMonitor cleanup**: Need to properly clean up PerformanceMonitor timeouts in Jest
2. **Resolve Expo offline start**: Need to get Expo server running for health checks
3. **Continue TypeScript error reduction**: With ESLint and Jest working, can proceed with systematic fixes

## Patch Status
**PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL** - Jest DevMenu TurboModule crash has been **completely resolved**. All 28 test suites now initialize successfully. However, there are cleanup issues with PerformanceMonitor timeouts and Expo server startup still needs work.

**Key Achievement:** Jest initialization is now working without DevMenu crashes, enabling test development and TypeScript error reduction work to proceed.

## Validation Results
- ✅ ESLint completes without OOM (959 problems but finishes)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works (245 errors but completes)
- ✅ TurboModuleRegistry mock found in Jest setup
- ✅ Jest tests initialize without DevMenu crashes
- ❌ Jest tests have cleanup issues with PerformanceMonitor
- ❌ Expo health-check failed (offline mode not working)
