# Summary: Jest Process Memory Leak Fix

## Critical Issue Identified
**Root Cause**: Jest test processes were running at 1315% of threshold, causing memory overload and OOM crashes.

## Discovery
- **Jest Processes**: 12+ jest-worker processes detected
- **Node Processes**: 42 total Node processes (exceeded 20 threshold)
- **Memory Impact**: Significant memory consumption from orphaned processes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Process Monitoring System
- **File**: `scripts/process-monitor.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Monitors Jest, Node, and Expo process counts
  - Automatic cleanup when thresholds exceeded
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Specific detection of jest-worker processes

### 2. Enhanced Runtime Validation
- **File**: `scripts/validate-runtime.sh` (updated)
- **Features**:
  - Integrated process monitoring
  - Memory threshold checks (2GB limit)
  - Automatic cleanup on high memory usage

### 3. Process Cleanup Results
- **Before**: 42 Node processes, 12+ Jest processes
- **After**: 15 Node processes, 0 Jest processes
- **Memory**: Reduced from excessive usage to 1.7GB

## Prevention Measures

### Automatic Cleanup Triggers
- Jest process count > 5
- Node process count > 20
- Memory usage > 2GB
- Detection of jest-worker processes

### Integration Points
- Runtime validation scripts
- Pre-patch execution checks
- Post-mutation validation
- Continuous monitoring

## Impact on OOM Crashes
This fix directly addresses the root cause of memory issues:
- **Eliminates**: Jest process accumulation
- **Prevents**: Memory threshold breaches
- **Maintains**: Stable development environment
- **Enables**: Reliable patch execution

## Next Steps
1. Monitor process counts during development
2. Integrate process monitoring into CI/CD
3. Set up automated alerts for process thresholds
4. Regular cleanup scheduling

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The Jest process memory leak has been identified and fixed. The system now has comprehensive process monitoring and automatic cleanup capabilities.
