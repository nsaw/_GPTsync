# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.557(P4.04.16)_jest-rn-preset-expo-devclient-fix

**Patch ID:** patch-v1.4.557(P4.04.16)_jest-rn-preset-expo-devclient-fix  
**Target:** BRAUN  
**Status:** PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL  
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-29 UTC  

## Description
Restore `jest-expo` preset + RN transform to stop React-Native import errors; start Expo with `--dev-client` so Metro responds on 8081.

## Execution Results

### ✅ Successfully Applied
- **Jest-expo preset restored**: Added `preset: 'jest-expo'` to Jest configuration
- **React Native transform ignore patterns**: Added `transformIgnorePatterns` to handle React Native ESM imports
- **Jest configuration updated**: Increased timeout to 70s and added proper module resolution
- **Jest config file cleanup**: Removed duplicate `jest.config.js` file to resolve configuration conflicts
- **ESLint still working**: ESLint continues to work with 959 problems (210 errors, 749 warnings) but no OOM
- **TypeScript compilation**: Works with 245 errors but completes without memory issues
- **Validation checks**: Confirm Jest preset presence in configuration

### ❌ Issues Encountered
- **Jest import scope errors persist**: Tests still fail with "You are trying to `import` a file outside of the scope of the test code"
- **React Native module resolution issues**: Jest cannot properly resolve React Native modules despite transform patterns
- **AsyncStorage native module errors**: Tests fail due to missing AsyncStorage native module
- **Expo health check failed**: Expo dev-client startup did not respond on port 8081 within the expected timeframe
- **Jest environment teardown issues**: Tests have cleanup problems with timers and async operations

## Technical Details

### Jest Configuration Changes
- **Preset**: Restored `jest-expo` preset for proper React Native testing setup
- **Transform Patterns**: Added patterns to handle React Native, Expo, and related modules
- **Module Resolution**: Configured proper roots and moduleDirectories for test discovery
- **Timeout**: Increased test timeout to 70 seconds for slower test execution

### Expo Startup Attempt
- **Dev Client Flag**: Used `--dev-client` flag to enable Metro dev server
- **Timeout**: Set 180-second timeout for Expo startup
- **Health Check**: Attempted to verify Metro response on port 8081
- **Result**: Expo startup did not complete successfully within the expected timeframe

## Validation Results

### ✅ Passed
- **ESLint**: Continues to work without OOM issues
- **TypeScript**: Compiles with 245 errors but completes
- **Jest Configuration**: Proper preset and transform patterns configured
- **File Structure**: Jest config conflicts resolved

### ❌ Failed
- **Jest Tests**: All 32 test suites failed due to import scope and module resolution issues
- **Expo Health Check**: Metro dev server did not respond on port 8081
- **React Native Integration**: Jest cannot properly handle React Native module imports

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Jest module resolution**: Investigate why transformIgnorePatterns are not working for React Native
2. **Resolve AsyncStorage mocking**: Add proper AsyncStorage mock for Jest environment
3. **Fix Expo startup**: Investigate why dev-client mode is not starting Metro properly
4. **Address import scope errors**: Fix Jest configuration to properly handle React Native imports

### Long-term Considerations
- **Jest setup overhaul**: May need to completely restructure Jest configuration for React Native compatibility
- **Expo configuration**: Review Expo configuration for proper dev server setup
- **Module mocking strategy**: Develop comprehensive mocking strategy for React Native modules

## Files Modified
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/jest.config.cjs` - Updated with jest-expo preset and transform patterns
- Removed duplicate `jest.config.js` file

## Summary
The patch successfully restored the jest-expo preset and added React Native transform ignore patterns, but Jest still cannot properly resolve React Native modules. The Expo dev-client startup also failed to respond on the expected port. While the configuration is now properly structured, the underlying React Native and Expo integration issues remain unresolved.

**Status**: PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL - Configuration fixed but runtime issues persist
