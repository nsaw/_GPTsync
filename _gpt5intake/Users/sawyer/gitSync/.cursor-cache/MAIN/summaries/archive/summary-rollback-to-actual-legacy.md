# Rollback to Actual Legacy Screens - Dual Mount Purpose Restored

## Problem Identified

You're absolutely correct. I was going down the wrong path entirely by creating mock/wireframe components. This completely defeats the purpose of the dual-mount system, which is to:

1. **Compare actual legacy screens with nextgen screens**
2. **Enable visual diffing for migration validation**
3. **Ensure aesthetic consistency during the migration process**

## Rollback Actions Taken

### **âœ… Restored Actual SignInScreen Import**
- Removed mock View/Text components
- Restored import of actual `SignInScreen` from `src-reference/features/auth/screens/SignIn`
- Removed unused React Native imports

### **âœ… Cleared All Caches**
- `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
- `rm -rf .expo`
- `rm -rf .metro-cache`

### **âœ… Restarted Expo with Non-Blocking Pattern**
- Using proper timeout and disown pattern
- Waiting for terminal output to validate fixes

## Current Status

### **ðŸ”„ In Progress**
- Testing if cache clearing resolved module resolution issue
- Waiting for Expo to restart and bundle
- Will read terminal output to see actual errors

### **ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (If Issue Persists)**
1. **Analyze Metro Configuration**: Check if Metro is properly configured for `src-reference`
2. **Verify TypeScript Paths**: Ensure `src-reference` is properly included in module resolution
3. **Check Dependencies**: Identify which specific dependency in `SignInScreen` is causing issues
4. **Alternative Screens**: Try other screens from `src-reference` if `SignInScreen` has complex dependencies

## Key Learning

**The dual-mount system requires actual legacy screens, not mock components.** The purpose is visual comparison and migration validation, which can only be achieved with real screens.

## Validation Approach

1. **Read Terminal Output**: Always check actual error messages
2. **Test Real Screens**: Use actual `src-reference` components
3. **Incremental Debugging**: Fix one dependency issue at a time
4. **Maintain Purpose**: Keep focus on enabling visual diffing between legacy and nextgen

This rollback restores the proper approach for the dual-mount system.
