## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Performance Monitor enhancements (comprehensive testing)
- Validation System improvements (extensive error handling)
- Environment System persistence (type-safe implementation)

### Medium Risk
- Theme System migration (requires legacy compatibility testing)
- Core Types validation (needs runtime verification)

### High Risk
- None identified in current hardening

## Compliance Status

- ✅ All patches include required validation gates
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling implemented
- ✅ Type safety enforced throughout
- ✅ Performance monitoring integrated
- ✅ Persistence mechanisms validated
- ✅ Migration paths established

## Summary
