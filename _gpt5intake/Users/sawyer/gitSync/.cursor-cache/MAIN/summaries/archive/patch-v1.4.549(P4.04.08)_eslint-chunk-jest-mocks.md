# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.549(P4.04.08)_eslint-chunk-jest-mocks

**Patch ID:** patch-v1.4.549(P4.04.08)_eslint-chunk-jest-mocks  
**Target:** BRAUN  
**Status:** PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL  
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-29 UTC  

## Description
Run ESLint in manageable chunks and stub missing globals so Jest no longer crashes on async/component-metric errors.

## Execution Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Applied
- `lint:chunk` script added to `package.json` with 8GB memory allocation
- Jest setup updated with React Native OS mock (`OS: 'ios'`)
- `performanceMonitor` global mock added to prevent component metric errors
- Jest config updated with `testTimeout: 30000` and `detectOpenHandles: true`
- TypeScript compilation works (shows 245 errors but completes)
- Expo health-check passes
- Validation checks confirm script and mock presence

### ‚ùå Issues Encountered
- **ESLint still OOMs**: Even with chunked approach (`src-nextgen` only) and 8GB memory, ESLint runs out of memory
- **Jest React Native mocking issues**: The React Native mock in `jest.setup.js` causes `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'DevMenu' could not be found` errors
- **Test execution blocked**: All 28 test suites fail due to React Native module loading issues

### üîß Technical Details
- **ESLint Memory Issue**: The codebase appears to be extremely large, requiring more aggressive chunking or different approaches
- **Jest Mock Complexity**: React Native mocking in Jest environment is complex due to native module dependencies
- **Memory Allocation**: 8GB memory allocation is insufficient for current ESLint configuration

## Validation Results
- ‚úÖ `lint:chunk` script found in `package.json`
- ‚úÖ `performanceMonitor` mock found in `jest.setup.js`
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation completes (245 errors, but no crashes)
- ‚úÖ Expo health-check passes
- ‚ùå ESLint chunked execution fails with OOM
- ‚ùå Jest tests fail due to React Native module issues

## Next Steps
1. **ESLint Strategy**: Consider even smaller chunks (individual directories) or disable ESLint temporarily for TypeScript error reduction
2. **Jest Strategy**: Simplify React Native mocking or use a different testing approach
3. **Memory Optimization**: Investigate ESLint configuration optimization or alternative linting approaches
4. **TypeScript Focus**: Proceed with TypeScript error reduction since compilation works

## Patch Status: PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL
The patch successfully implemented the chunked ESLint approach and Jest mocks, but the underlying memory and React Native mocking issues require additional work. The infrastructure is in place for future improvements.

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/package.json` (added `lint:chunk` script)
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/jest.setup.js` (added React Native and performanceMonitor mocks)
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/jest.config.js` (added timeout and open handles detection)

**Ready for:** TypeScript error reduction patches (since TypeScript compilation works)
**Blocked by:** ESLint memory issues and Jest React Native mocking complexity
