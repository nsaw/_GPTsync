## Patch Analysis

### Pre-Execution Assessment
- **AutoRoleView Component**: Already enhanced with comprehensive accessibility props
- **RoleSystem Types**: Already updated with ariaModal and enhanced validation properties
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Already integrated and functional
- **Test Files**: Missing and needed to be created

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. AutoRoleView Component ✅
The component already contained all the enhancements specified in the patch:
- Comprehensive accessibility props (ariaLabel, ariaPressed, ariaExpanded, etc.)
- Performance monitoring integration via `usePerformanceMonitor`
- Error boundary support with fallback components
- Strict prop validation with console warnings
- Enhanced TypeScript types and interfaces

#### 2. RoleSystem Types ✅
The `RoleSystem.ts` file already contained:
- `ariaModal` property in `RoleAccessibility` interface
- Enhanced validation properties (validationLevel, errorReporting, etc.)
- Comprehensive accessibility interface with all required props

#### 3. Test Files Created ✅
- **AutoRoleView.test.tsx**: Unit tests for core functionality
- **AutoRoleView.integration.test.tsx**: Integration tests for theme and nested structures

## Validation Results

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Exit code: 0 - No TypeScript errors
```

### ✅ ESLint Validation
```bash
npm run lint
# Multiple warnings/errors in existing codebase, but none related to AutoRoleView
# AutoRoleView component passes linting
```

### ⚠️ Test Execution
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=AutoRoleView --watchAll=false
# Tests created but failing due to broader Jest configuration issues
# Error: "You are trying to `import` a file outside of the scope of the test code"
```
