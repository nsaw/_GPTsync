# Phase 6.5 + 7 Non-Blocking Hardening Audit (UNVERIFIED)

- Agent: BRAUN (MAIN)
- Date: 2025-08-08 UTC
- Scope: P6.5 + P7 patches, strategy docs
- Status: UNVERIFIED (no patches executed per instruction)

## Findings
- Non-blocking enforcement inconsistent in several patches (Expo refresh and curl gating inline).
- Some postMutationBuild steps used inline `curl` checks; allowed but brittle.
- Many patches already include tsc/eslint/tests/maestro; good coverage.

## Edits Made
- Added CLI helpers:
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/scripts/cli/expo-refresh-nonblocking.sh`
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/scripts/cli/validate-expo-status.sh`
- Updated selected patches to call helpers without removing migration logic:
  - `phase-6.5/patch-v1.4.652(P6.5.06)_integrate-all-components.json` (Expo refresh + device log grep + status gate)
  - `phase-6.5/patch-v1.4.657(P6.5.16)_final-comprehensive-validation.json` (Expo refresh + device log grep + status gate)
  - `phase-6.5/patch-v1.4.6514(P6.5.30)_final-complete-system-validation.json` (Expo refresh + device log grep + status gate)
  - `phase-7/patch-v1.4.7711(P7.01.01)_app-icons.json` (status gate via helper)
- Added maintenance script (no auto-run, documentation only):
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/maintenance/harden-phase6.5-7-nonblocking.sh` (Expo refresh replacement only; no mutation logic removal)
- Strategy docs updated to reference the helpers in execution protocols.

## Notes
- No reordering or new JSON patches created.
- All edits preserved existing mutations/logic; only swapped the refresh/status lines for hardened equivalents and added device log grep where missing.
- Next candidates for helper substitution (manual, surgical): remaining P6.5/P7 patches with inline `expo start` + `curl`.

## Next (Manual) Steps
- Apply the same helper swap to the rest of P6.5/P7 patches, one by one, verifying no loss of logic.
- Keep versions and folder order intact; do not renumber.
- When ready to validate, run standard app refresh + gates as per enforcement doc.
