patchName: validation-run-20250808
Roadmap: Phase - Tunnel/Service Resilience

Status: PARTIAL
Timestamp: 2025-08-08T00:00:00Z

Inputs Executed:
- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/validate-all.sh (non-blocking)
- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-test.sh (non-blocking)

Logs:
- validate-all: /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/validation.log
- unified-test: /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches/.logs/unified-test.log
- aux: /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/validation-tests.log

Observed Results (from disk logs):
- validate-all: "SOME SYSTEMS UNHEALTHY" (no granular breakdown written by script to validation.log)
- unified-test:
  - PM2 processes: all PASS (alert-engine-daemon, autonomous-decision-daemon, dashboard-uplink, dual-monitor, enhanced-doc-daemon, flask-dashboard, ghost-bridge, ghost-relay, ghost-runner, ghost-viewer, metrics-aggregator-daemon, patch-executor, summary-monitor, telemetry-orchestrator)
  - Ports: FAIL for Port 5555 (Flask App). Note: current Flask dashboard is configured on 8787 (/api/health). Test script likely stale for Flask port.
- validation-tests.log (aux): indicates pending work on log-failure pause path; PM2 restart scaffolding present.

Interpretation:
- The FAIL on port 5555 appears to be a config mismatch with the new port (8787). This would cause validate-all to flag "some systems unhealthy" if it inherits the same check set.

Next Actions:
- Align test expectations to current config:
  - Update unified-test to use 8787 for Flask dashboard and /api/health endpoint.
  - Optionally add an alias listener at 5555 if required by external tooling.
- Re-run both scripts with stdout teeâ€™d to dedicated logs for full breakdown.

Validation Gates:
- enforceValidationGate: true
- strictRuntimeAudit: true
- runDryCheck: true
- forceRuntimeTrace: true
- requireMutationProof: true
- requireServiceUptime: true

Agent validation: PENDING | Awaiting re-run after test script alignment to current port map.
