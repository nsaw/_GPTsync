# Summary: Port 8787 Conflict Diagnosis and Repair

**Date**: 2025-08-07T01:15:00Z  
**Issue**: Port 8787 conflict preventing unified-manager.sh from starting flask-dashboard  
**Status**: üîß **IN PROGRESS - REPAIRING**

## üîç **DIAGNOSIS**

### **Root Cause Identified**
1. **Port Management Issue**: `manage_port()` function was killing Python processes directly instead of stopping PM2 services first
2. **Watchdog Mismatch**: Unified-manager.sh configured to use `flask-dashboard-watchdog.sh` (doesn't exist) instead of `flask-watchdog.sh`
3. **Port Mismatch**: Flask-watchdog.sh was monitoring port 5555 instead of 8787
4. **Health Endpoint Mismatch**: Using `/health` instead of `/api/health`
5. **Non-blocking Pattern Violation**: PM2 commands not properly wrapped in timeout/disown patterns

### **Death Spiral Analysis**
- Flask-dashboard was running in PM2 (21 restarts indicating instability)
- Unified-manager.sh tried to start flask-dashboard
- `manage_port()` killed the Python process directly instead of stopping PM2 service
- PM2 service was deleted but process remained
- Watchdog tried to restart, creating conflict
- Loop continued with port 8787 never being properly cleared

## üîß **REPAIRS APPLIED**

### **1. Fixed Port Management**
```bash
# Before: Direct process killing
echo "$pids" | xargs kill -TERM 2>/dev/null || true

# After: PM2 service management first
case "$port" in
    "8787") pm2_service="flask-dashboard" ;;
    # ... other ports
esac
if [ -n "$pm2_service" ]; then
    pm2 stop "$pm2_service" --silent 2>/dev/null || true
    pm2 delete "$pm2_service" --silent 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

### **2. Fixed Watchdog Configuration**
```bash
# Before: Non-existent watchdog
"flask-dashboard") echo "pm2:flask-dashboard:dashboard/app.py:8787:http://localhost:8787/:flask-dashboard-watchdog.sh:" ;;

# After: Correct watchdog
"flask-dashboard") echo "pm2:flask-dashboard:dashboard/app.py:8787:http://localhost:8787/api/health:flask-watchdog.sh:" ;;
```

### **3. Fixed Flask Watchdog Port**
```bash
# Before: Wrong port
FLASK_PORT=5555

# After: Correct port
FLASK_PORT=8787
```

### **4. Fixed Health Endpoint**
```bash
# Before: Wrong endpoint
FLASK_HEALTH_URL="http://localhost:$FLASK_PORT/health"

# After: Correct endpoint
FLASK_HEALTH_URL="http://localhost:$FLASK_PORT/api/health"
```

### **5. Added Non-blocking Patterns**
```bash
# Before: Blocking PM2 commands
pm2 start "$script_path" --name "$service_id" --silent

# After: Non-blocking with timeout
{ timeout 30s pm2 start "$script_path" --name "$service_id" --silent & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown
```

## üö® **REMAINING ISSUES**

### **Non-blocking Pattern Problem**
The current non-blocking implementation is preventing PM2 commands from executing properly. The `{ command & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown` pattern is too aggressive for PM2 commands that need to complete.

### **File Corruption Issue**
The dashboard/app.py file was corrupted with malformed triple quotes, causing syntax errors. This was fixed by restoring from git history.

### **Required Fix**
Need to use a different non-blocking pattern for PM2 commands:
```bash
# For PM2 commands that need to complete
( timeout 30s pm2 start "$script_path" --name "$service_id" --silent ) &
PID=$!
sleep 30
disown $PID
```

### **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ Flask-dashboard can be started manually via PM2
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint responds correctly: `{"status":"healthy"}`
- ‚úÖ Port 8787 conflict resolved
- ‚ùå Unified-manager.sh still hangs due to non-blocking pattern issues

## üìã **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix PM2 Non-blocking Pattern**: Use proper timeout/disown pattern for PM2 commands
2. **Test Flask Dashboard**: Verify flask-dashboard starts and responds on port 8787
3. **Test Unified Manager**: Verify unified-manager.sh can start all services
4. **Monitor Stability**: Ensure no more death spiral loops

## üéØ **VALIDATION CRITERIA**

- [x] Flask-dashboard starts successfully via manual PM2 command
- [x] Health endpoint responds: `curl http://localhost:8787/api/health`
- [x] PM2 shows flask-dashboard as online
- [x] No port conflicts on 8787
- [ ] All PM2 commands use proper non-blocking patterns
- [ ] Unified-manager.sh can start flask-dashboard without hanging

## ‚úÖ **ISSUES RESOLVED**

1. **Port 8787 Conflict**: Fixed by updating `manage_port()` to stop PM2 services before killing processes
2. **Watchdog Mismatch**: Fixed by using correct `flask-watchdog.sh` instead of non-existent `flask-dashboard-watchdog.sh`
3. **Port Mismatch**: Fixed by updating flask-watchdog.sh to monitor port 8787 instead of 5555
4. **Health Endpoint**: Fixed by using `/api/health` instead of `/health`
5. **File Corruption**: Fixed by restoring dashboard/app.py from git history
6. **Non-blocking Patterns**: Partially fixed - PM2 commands still need refinement

**Agent Validation**: PENDING - Awaiting live state confirmation from dashboard/user.
