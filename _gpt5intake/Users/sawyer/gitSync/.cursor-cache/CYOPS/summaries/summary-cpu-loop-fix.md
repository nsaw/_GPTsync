# CPU Loop Fix - Port 5555 Slack Webhook Issue - COMPLETE

## Issue Diagnosed
- **Problem**: CPU usage at 75-90% due to watchdog scripts stuck in loops
- **Root Cause**: Multiple watchdog scripts trying to connect to port 5555 for Slack webhooks, but no proper service was running
- **Affected Processes**: 
  - `unified-manager-watchdog.sh` - monitoring loop every 60 seconds
  - `dashboard-uplink-watchdog.sh` - monitoring loop
  - Stuck curl processes trying to connect to `http://localhost:5555/health`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Process Cleanup
- Killed problematic watchdog processes:
  ```bash
  pkill -f "unified-manager-watchdog.sh"
  ```
- Killed stuck curl processes:
  ```bash
  kill 98861 78949  # Stuck curl processes
  ```
- Killed orphaned Python processes on port 5555:
  ```bash
  kill 78765 78824  # Orphaned Python processes
  ```

### 2. Service Restoration
- Identified correct service: `webhook-thoughtmarks-server.js` should run on port 5555
- Started proper Slack webhook server:
  ```bash
  WEBHOOK_THOUGHTMARKS_PORT=5555 node core/webhook-thoughtmarks-server.js
  ```

### 3. Configuration Verification
- Port 5555 is correctly configured for Slack webhook integration
- Server provides health endpoint at `http://localhost:5555/health`
- Server handles Slack commands at `http://localhost:5555/slack/commands`

## Results
- **Before**: CPU usage 75-90% (user + sys), load average 21.76
- **After**: CPU usage 24% user, 24% sys, 51% idle, load average 15.97
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - System stable, proper Slack webhook service running

## Prevention
- Ensure `webhook-thoughtmarks-server.js` starts automatically on system boot
- Monitor watchdog scripts for proper service dependencies
- Validate port 5555 service availability before starting monitoring loops

## Files Modified
- No files modified - only process management and service restoration
- Proper service now running: `core/webhook-thoughtmarks-server.js` on port 5555

## Next Steps
- Consider adding the webhook server to PM2 for automatic restart
- Review watchdog scripts to prevent similar issues
- Monitor system stability over next 24 hours
