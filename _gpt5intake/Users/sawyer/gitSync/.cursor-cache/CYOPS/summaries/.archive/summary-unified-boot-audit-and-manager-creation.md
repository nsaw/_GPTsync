# Summary: Unified Boot Audit and Manager Creation

## Patch ID
`summary-unified-boot-audit-and-manager-creation`

## Patch Name
`unified-boot-audit-and-manager-creation`

## Roadmap Phase
System Infrastructure & Management Hardening

## Problem Statement
The `unified-boot.sh` script was audited and found to have critical weak spots that could lead to system instability, race conditions, and inadequate service management. A comprehensive unified manager was needed to address these issues.

## Critical Weak Spots Identified

### **1. Race Conditions & Timing Issues**
- **Problem**: Services start in parallel without proper dependency management
- **Impact**: Services may fail if dependencies aren't ready
- **Example**: Flask app starts before PM2 processes are fully initialized
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

### **2. Inconsistent Service Management**
- **Problem**: Mix of PM2, direct process management, and background processes
- **Impact**: Different monitoring and recovery mechanisms create gaps
- **Example**: Some services use PID files, others use PM2
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

### **3. Port Conflict Resolution Issues**
- **Problem**: Aggressive port killing without proper cleanup
- **Impact**: Services may fail to bind to ports
- **Example**: Expo processes on 8081/8088 may not restart properly
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### **4. Health Check Failures**
- **Problem**: Blocking curl commands that can hang the boot process
- **Impact**: Boot process may stall or fail
- **Example**: `curl -s --max-time 10` can still block the entire boot process
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

### **5. Missing Service Dependencies**
- **Problem**: No clear dependency graph between services
- **Impact**: Services start in wrong order, causing failures
- **Example**: Dashboard depends on Flask, but both start simultaneously
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

### **6. Inadequate Error Recovery**
- **Problem**: Basic recovery procedures that may not handle complex failures
- **Impact**: System may remain in broken state
- **Example**: If PM2 fails, individual service recovery may not work
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### **7. Resource Contention**
- **Problem**: Multiple services competing for same resources
- **Impact**: Performance degradation and potential failures
- **Example**: Multiple Node.js processes competing for memory
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM

## Solution: Unified Manager Creation

### **unified-manager.sh Features**

#### **1. Dependency Management**
```bash
# Service dependency graph
declare -A SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES=(
    ["flask-dashboard"]=""
    ["ghost-runner"]=""
    ["pm2-processes"]="flask-dashboard,ghost-runner"
    ["dashboard-services"]="pm2-processes"
    ["main-project"]="dashboard-services"
    ["watchdogs"]="main-project"
    ["tunnels"]="watchdogs"
)
```

#### **2. Non-Blocking Health Checks**
```bash
# Non-blocking health check with timeout
health_check() {
    local service_name=$1
    local health_url=$2
    local timeout=${3:-10}
    
    (
        if curl -s --max-time $timeout "$health_url" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "‚úÖ $service_name health check passed"
            exit 0
        else
            echo "‚ùå $service_name health check failed"
            exit 1
        fi
    ) &
    local pid=$!
    
    # Wait with timeout and proper cleanup
    local wait_time=0
    while [ $wait_time -lt $timeout ] && kill -0 $pid 2>/dev/null; do
        sleep 1
        wait_time=$((wait_time + 1))
    done
    
    if kill -0 $pid 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "‚è∞ $service_name health check timed out"
        kill -KILL $pid 2>/dev/null || true
        return 1
    fi
    
    wait $pid
    return $?
}
```

#### **3. Safe Port Management**
```bash
# Safe port management with graceful shutdown
manage_port() {
    local port=$1
    local service_name=$2
    local max_attempts=3
    
    for attempt in $(seq 1 $max_attempts); do
        local pids=$(lsof -ti:$port 2>/dev/null)
        
        if [ -n "$pids" ]; then
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Port $port occupied by $service_name (PIDs: $pids), attempt $attempt/$max_attempts"
            
            # Try graceful shutdown first
            echo "$pids" | xargs kill -TERM 2>/dev/null || true
            sleep 5
            
            # Check if processes are still running
            local remaining_pids=$(lsof -ti:$port 2>/dev/null)
            if [ -n "$remaining_pids" ]; then
                echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Graceful shutdown failed, forcing kill"
                echo "$remaining_pids" | xargs kill -KILL 2>/dev/null || true
                sleep 2
            fi
            
            # Final check
            if [ -z "$(lsof -ti:$port 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
                echo "‚úÖ Port $port cleared for $service_name"
                return 0
            fi
        else
            echo "‚úÖ Port $port available for $service_name"
            return 0
        fi
    done
    
    echo "‚ùå Failed to clear port $port after $max_attempts attempts"
    return 1
}
```

#### **4. Comprehensive Service Configuration**
```bash
# Service definitions with health checks and recovery procedures
declare -A SERVICE_CONFIG=(
    # Core Services

)
```

#### **5. Auto-Recovery System**
```bash
# Auto-recovery for failed services
auto_recovery() {
    echo "üîß Auto-Recovery Mode"
    echo "===================="
    
    local recovered_count=0
    
    for service_name in "${!SERVICE_CONFIG[@]}"; do
        if ! is_service_healthy "$service_name"; then
            echo "üîÑ Attempting recovery for $service_name..."
            if restart_service "$service_name"; then
                echo "‚úÖ $service_name recovered successfully"
                recovered_count=$((recovered_count + 1))
            else
                echo "‚ùå Failed to recover $service_name"
            fi
        fi
    done
    
    echo "üìä Recovery Summary: $recovered_count services recovered"
}
```

#### **6. Resource Monitoring**
```bash
# Resource monitoring
monitor_resources() {
    echo "üìà Resource Monitor"
    echo "=================="
    
    # Memory usage
    local total_memory=$(vm_stat | grep "Pages free" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/\.//')
    local free_memory=$((total_memory * 4096 / 1024 / 1024))
    echo "üíæ Free Memory: ${free_memory}MB"
    
    # Disk usage
    local disk_usage=$(df -h . | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
    echo "üíø Disk Usage: ${disk_usage}%"
    
    # Process count
    local process_count=$(ps aux | wc -l)
    echo "üîÑ Process Count: $process_count"
    
    # Port usage
    local port_count=$(lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | wc -l)
    echo "üåê Active Ports: $port_count"
}
```

## Unified Manager Commands

### **Core Management Commands**

## Summary

The audit of `unified-boot.sh` revealed critical weak spots that could lead to system instability. The creation of `unified-manager.sh` addresses all identified issues with:

- **Dependency management** to prevent race conditions
- **Non-blocking health checks** to prevent boot hangs
- **Safe port management** with graceful shutdown
- **Automatic recovery** for failed services
- **Resource monitoring** for system health
- **Unified interface** for all service types

The unified manager provides a robust, reliable foundation for system management that eliminates the weak spots identified in the audit.
