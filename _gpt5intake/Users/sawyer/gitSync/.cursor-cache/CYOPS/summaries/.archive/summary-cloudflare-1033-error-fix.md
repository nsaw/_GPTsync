# Cloudflare 1033 Error Diagnosis and Repair Summary

## Issue Resolution Status: ✅ COMPLETE
**Agent**: CYOPS  
**Operation**: Cloudflare Tunnel 1033 Error Diagnosis and Repair  
**Status**: ✅ PASS

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Cloudflare 1033 Error - RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues with tunnel configuration and conflicting processes
  - Tunnel config missing required catch-all ingress rule
  - Conflicting cloudflared processes running with tokens instead of tunnel names
  - Incorrect credentials file path in config
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Fixed tunnel config to include catch-all rule: `- service: http_status:404`
  - Updated credentials file path to use correct tunnel ID: `f1545c78-1a94-408f-ba6b-9c4223b4c2bf.json`
  - Killed conflicting cloudflared processes
  - Started tunnel with corrected configuration
- **Result**: Monitor endpoint now returns 200 OK

### 2. **CPU Usage Verification - CONFIRMED**
- **Status**: ✅ Below 50% threshold
- **Current Usage**: 19.5% (8.34% user + 11.16% sys, 80.49% idle)

## Technical Details

### Tunnel Configuration Fix
```yaml
tunnel: gpt-cursor-runner
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/f1545c78-1a94-408f-ba6b-9c4223b4c2bf.json

ingress:
  - hostname: gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app
    service: http://localhost:8787
    originRequest:
      noTLSVerify: true
  # Catch-all rule (required by cloudflared)
  - service: http_status:404
```

### Key Issues Resolved
1. **Missing Catch-All Rule**: Cloudflared requires the last ingress rule to match all URLs
2. **Process Conflicts**: Multiple cloudflared processes with tokens were preventing tunnel connection
3. **Credentials Path**: Updated to use correct tunnel ID instead of generic name

## Validation Results
