# Monitor Endpoint 502 Error Fix

## Issue Resolution Status: ✅ COMPLETE
**Agent**: CYOPS  
**Operation**: Monitor Endpoint 502 Error Diagnosis and Repair  
**Status**: ✅ PASS

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Monitor Endpoint 502/530 Error - RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause**: Cloudflare tunnel was not running, causing the external endpoint to return 502/530 errors
- **Issue**: No active cloudflared process was running to route traffic from `gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app` to the local monitor server
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Confirmed local monitor server was working correctly (http://localhost:8787/monitor returns 200 OK)
  - Verified tunnel configuration was correct in `config/tunnel-config.yml`
  - Confirmed credentials file exists: `~/.cloudflared/f1545c78-1a94-408f-ba6b-9c4223b4c2bf.json`
  - Started cloudflared tunnel using proper non-blocking execution pattern
  - Verified tunnel is active and connected with multiple edge locations

### 2. **System Health Validation - CONFIRMED**
- **CPU Usage**: 33.48% (16.79% user + 16.69% sys) - ✅ Below 50% threshold
- **Local Monitor Server**: ✅ Running and responding correctly
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: ✅ Active and connected to multiple edge locations

- **Status**: ✅ Active and connected

## Validation Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ External endpoint: HTTP/2 530 (Cloudflare error)
- ❌ No cloudflared processes running

### After Fix
- ✅ External endpoint: HTTP/2 200 OK
- ✅ Full HTML response returned
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel active and connected
- ✅ CPU usage: 33.48% (below 50% threshold)

## Commands Executed
```bash
# Verified local monitor server
curl -I http://localhost:8787/monitor

# Started tunnel with proper configuration
{ cloudflared tunnel --config config/tunnel-config.yml run & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown

# Verified tunnel status
cloudflared tunnel info gpt-cursor-runner

# Tested external endpoint
curl -I https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor
```

## Summary
The monitor endpoint is now fully functional and returning 200 OK responses. The Cloudflare tunnel is properly configured and actively routing traffic from the external domain to the local monitor server. All system health metrics are within acceptable ranges.
