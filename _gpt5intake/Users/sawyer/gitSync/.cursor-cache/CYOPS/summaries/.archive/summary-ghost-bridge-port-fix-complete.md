# Summary: Ghost Bridge Port Conflict Resolution

**Date**: 2025-08-04T22:35:00Z  
**Patch ID**: ghost-bridge-port-3456-fix  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  

## **Changes Made**

### **Ghost Bridge Port Change**
- **Previous Port**: 3000 (conflicting with other services)
- **New Port**: 3456 (resolved conflict)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/ghost-bridge.js` - Changed default port from 3000 to 3456
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/ghost-thoughtmarks-config.yml` - Updated tunnel configuration to point to port 3456

### **Service Status**
- **✅ Local Service**: Ghost Bridge running on port 3456 and responding to health checks
- **⚠️ Tunnel Status**: ghost-thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app tunnel connecting but showing error 1016
- **✅ Other Tunnels**: gpt-cursor-runner and webhook-thoughtmarks tunnels working correctly

## **Current System Status**

### **BATCH 1: STATUS API & AUTONOMOUS TRIGGER** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Real-Time Status API: Running on port 8789
- Autonomous Patch Trigger: Running on port 8790
- Both services added to unified-boot.sh critical list

### **BATCH 2: TUNNELS** ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**
- gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app: ✅ RUNNING (200 OK)
- webhook-thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app: ✅ RUNNING (200 OK)
- ghost-thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app: ⚠️ Tunnel connecting but error 1016
- ghost.thoughtmarks.app: ❌ Needs configuration

### **BATCH 3: MAIN DASHBOARD** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor: ✅ RUNNING (200 OK)
- Visual validation confirmed
- Health endpoint responding correctly

## **Technical Details**

### **Port Conflict Resolution**
The Ghost Bridge was conflicting with other services on port 3000. Successfully moved to port 3456:
```javascript
// Before
const PORT = process.env.SLACK_PORT || 3000;

// After  
const PORT = process.env.SLACK_PORT || 3456;
```

### **Tunnel Configuration Update**
Updated the Cloudflare tunnel configuration to point to the new port:
```yaml
# Before
service: http://localhost:3000

# After
service: http://localhost:3456
```

### **Service Verification**
- Local health check: `{"status":"healthy","port":3456}`
- Process listening: Confirmed on port 3456
- Tunnel connection: Established but showing error 1016

## **Remaining Issues**

### **Ghost Tunnel Error 1016**
The ghost-thoughtmarks tunnel is connecting successfully but returning error 1016. This may be:
- Temporary Cloudflare issue
- Configuration problem requiring additional investigation
- Service not responding as expected to tunnel requests

### **Ghost.thoughtmarks.app**
The ghost.thoughtmarks.app tunnel still needs configuration and setup.

## **Agent Validation: PENDING**

**Automated Status**: PORT_CONFLICT_RESOLVED | TUNNEL_PARTIALLY_WORKING | DASHBOARD_OPERATIONAL  
**Live State**: Awaiting full tunnel validation  
**User/GPT Validation**: REQUIRED for tunnel error 1016 investigation

Awaiting live state confirmation from dashboard/user.
