- **Resource monitoring**: Integrated system resource tracking and management

### **3. Automated Monitoring and Auto-Recovery** ✅
- **Cron job setup**: Added 1-minute interval monitoring via crontab
- **Watchdog script**: Created `unified-manager-watchdog.sh` for continuous monitoring
- **Auto-recovery**: Integrated automatic service recovery for failed services
- **Log management**: All monitoring logs saved to `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/logs/`

### **4. Comprehensive System Health Tracking** ✅
- **New API endpoint**: Added `/api/manager-status` to Flask dashboard
- **Live health data**: Real-time service status from unified manager
- **PM2 integration**: Direct PM2 status monitoring and reporting
- **Resource tracking**: System resource monitoring and reporting
- **Service details**: Individual service health status and metrics

### **5. Dashboard Integration** ✅
- **API integration**: Dashboard now polls `/api/manager-status` every 30s
- **Live data population**: All system panels populated from unified manager data
- **Service status**: Real-time health status for all 18 managed services
- **Resource monitoring**: Live CPU, memory, and system resource tracking

### **6. Dual-Agent Dashboard Live Wiring** ✅
- **Agent panels**: CYOPS/DEV and MAIN/BRAUN panels connected to unified manager
- **Live status**: Real-time health and status updates from unified manager
- **Telemetry integration**: Dashboard telemetry system integrated with unified manager
- **Service monitoring**: All 18 services now monitored through unified interface

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Boot Process Changes**
```bash
# Before: Individual service startup
start_service_with_verification "Flask App" "command" "pid_file" "health_url"

# After: Unified manager orchestration
"$UNIFIED_MANAGER" start all
"$UNIFIED_MANAGER" monitor
"$UNIFIED_MANAGER" recover
```

### **API Integration**
```python
@app.route('/api/manager-status')
def get_manager_status():
    # Integrates with unified-manager.sh for live system status
    # Returns comprehensive service health and resource data
```

### **Watchdog Implementation**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring with auto-recovery
while true; do
    monitor_services
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        auto_recovery
    fi
    sleep 60
done
```

### **Cron Job Setup**
```bash
# 1-minute interval monitoring
*/1 * * * * /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-manager.sh monitor >> /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/logs/unified-manager-monitor.log 2>&1
```

## **System Status After Integration**

### **Services Managed (18 total)**
- ✅ **PM2 Services (14)**: All managed through unified manager

./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh start          # Start all services
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh stop           # Stop all services
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh restart        # Restart all services
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh monitor        # Monitor all services
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh recover        # Auto-recovery
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh resources      # System resources
./scripts/core/unified-manager.sh health <service> # Individual health check
```
