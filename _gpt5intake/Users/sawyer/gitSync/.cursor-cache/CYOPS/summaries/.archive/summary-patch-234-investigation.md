# Patch 234 Investigation Summary

**Issue**: Patch `patch-v1.4.234(P0.2.17)_slot-selector-and-slotquery-integration.json` was POSTed to webhook but never arrived on disk.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Confirmed Working Components
1. **PatchRouter Validation**: Schema validation works correctly
2. **Patch Executor Loop**: Processes patches and moves them to .completed/.failed correctly
3. **Webhook Endpoint**: Accepts POST requests and returns 200 OK
4. **File Handoff**: CYOPS to MAIN handoff works correctly

### ❌ Root Cause Identified
**Patch 234 was never stored on disk by the patchRouter**

### Evidence
1. **No patch files found**: `find /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ -name "*234*"` returns no results
2. **Patch executor logs**: Show no processing of patch 234
3. **Webhook response**: 200 OK only indicates HTTP success, not disk storage success

### Possible Causes
1. **Schema Validation Failed**: Patch missing required fields (`blockId`, `mutations[0].path`, `version`)
2. **File System Error**: Permission or disk space issues
3. **Server Exception**: patchRouter threw an error during processing
4. **Network Issue**: Request reached server but failed during processing

### Required Fixes
1. **Enhanced Logging**: patchRouter should log all incoming patches
2. **Detailed Error Responses**: Return specific error messages for validation failures
3. **Disk Write Verification**: Confirm files are actually written
4. **Patch Content Validation**: Log patch structure for debugging

### Current Status
- **PatchRouter**: ✅ Working correctly for valid patches
- **Patch Executor**: ✅ Working correctly (when running)
- **Missing Patch**: ❌ Never reached disk storage phase

### Next Steps
1. Enhance patchRouter logging to capture all incoming patches
2. Add detailed error reporting for failed patches
3. Implement patch content validation and logging
4. Monitor webhook requests to identify why patch 234 failed
