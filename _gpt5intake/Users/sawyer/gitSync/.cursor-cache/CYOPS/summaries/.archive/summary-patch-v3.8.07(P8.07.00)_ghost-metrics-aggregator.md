### Telemetry Sources Integrated
1. **Dashboard**: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk) and daemon health ratios
2. **Relay**: Performance metrics (response times, success rates, queue lengths)
3. **Heartbeat**: Health metrics (clock drift, daemon health, ping latency)
4. **Loop Auditor**: Loop performance and anomaly metrics (placeholder)
5. **Snapshot**: System state and historical metrics (placeholder)

### Analytics Capabilities

- **Memory Management**: Configurable history limits (10K metrics, 1K trends, 500 anomalies)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Efficient data processing with configurable intervals

### Metrics Processing Pipeline
1. **Collection**: Gather metrics from all enabled sources
2. **Extraction**: Extract relevant metrics based on source type
3. **Aggregation**: Combine and normalize metrics from multiple sources
4. **Analysis**: Perform trend analysis and anomaly detection
5. **Scoring**: Calculate system health scores
6. **Storage**: Persist aggregated data and analysis results
7. **Integration**: Send results to dashboard and alert systems

### Health Scoring Factors
- **Performance (30% weight)**: Response time metrics with 2-second threshold
- **Reliability (40% weight)**: Health ratios and system stability metrics
- **Availability (30% weight)**: Service availability based on active sources
- **Security (placeholder)**: Security metrics (currently set to 100)

### Trend Analysis Features
- **Time Range**: 5-minute trend detection windows
- **Change Detection**: 5% threshold for trend classification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on change magnitude and data points
- **Trend Types**: Increasing, decreasing, stable with confidence levels
- **Data Requirements**: Minimum 10 data points for trend analysis

### Anomaly Detection Features
- **Deviation Threshold**: 20% deviation from baseline triggers anomaly
- **Severity Classification**: Low (20-30%), Medium (30-50%), High (50%+), Critical (50%+)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on deviation magnitude
- **Resolution Tracking**: Anomaly resolution status tracking
- **Data Requirements**: Minimum 20 data points for anomaly detection

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and trends delivery
- **Alert System**: Anomaly and performance threshold alerts
- **File System**: State persistence and configuration management
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging to `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/logs/metrics-aggregator.log`

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Limits**: Configurable history limits prevent memory issues
