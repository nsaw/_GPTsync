# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand

## Patch Details
- **Version**: patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand
- **Description**: Fix legacy fallback leak by syncing forced bootstrap hydration result with Zustand and AppShell state resolution
- **Target**: MAIN
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced dualMountBootstrap.tsx
- **Added forced process.env override**: Explicitly overrides `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` to 'nextgen' for runtime consistency
- **Added Zustand sync**: Integrates with EnvironmentStore for state synchronization
- **Added AppShell state resolution verification**: Verifies that AppShell resolves to correct environment
- **Enhanced hydration checks**: Added 7 comprehensive checks including processEnvOverride, zustandSync, and appShellResolution
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages with failed check identification

### 2. Enhanced EnvironmentStore.ts
- **Added last-mile guard**: Ensures process.env is overridden for runtime consistency
- **Added hydration status tracking**: Tracks hydration status (pending/success/failed/blocked)
- **Added AppShell fallback resolver**: Enhanced fallback logic with consistency guards
- **Added forceHydration method**: Allows manual re-hydration when needed
- **Added getHydrationStatus method**: Provides hydration status information

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Required Validation Checks Passed

1. **✅ FORCED HYDRATION: EnvironmentStore hydrated nextgen from file** - CONFIRMED
2. **✅ FORCED HYDRATION: AppShell: Environment is nextgen** - CONFIRMED  
3. **✅ No runtime logs show 'legacy' as resolved state after hydration** - CONFIRMED
4. **✅ Process.env explicitly overridden for runtime masking** - CONFIRMED
5. **✅ All logs show environment=nextgen or source=file** - CONFIRMED
6. **✅ Theme + Auth hydration follows environment init** - CONFIRMED

### Runtime Log Evidence
```
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: EnvironmentStore hydrated nextgen from file
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: AppShell: Environment is nextgen (source: file)
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: AppShell: Confirmed nextgen environment from file
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: All hydration checks passed - environment=nextgen
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: Explicitly overrode process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT to nextgen
LOG  ✅ FORCED HYDRATION: EnvironmentStore last-mile guard overrode process.env to nextgen
```

## Technical Implementation

### Bootstrap Hydration Chain
1. **File Read**: Reads from env.app file (source of truth)
2. **Environment Parse**: Parses EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT value
3. **Process.env Override**: Explicitly overrides process.env for runtime consistency
4. **Zustand Sync**: Synchronizes with EnvironmentStore
5. **AppShell Verification**: Verifies AppShell state resolution
6. **Completion Check**: Validates all hydration checks pass

### State Resolution Flow
```
env.app → dualMountBootstrap → EnvironmentStore → AppShell → UI Components
```

### Fallback Prevention
- **File-based hydration**: Primary source is env.app file
- **Process.env override**: Explicitly overrides stale process.env values
- **Last-mile guards**: Multiple layers of consistency checks
- **State verification**: Validates state consistency across all layers

## Impact

### Before Patch
- Legacy fallback leaks occurred
- Inconsistent environment state across components
- Process.env values could override file-based settings
- No unified hydration chain

### After Patch
- **Single source of truth**: env.app file is the authoritative source
- **Consistent state**: All components resolve to same environment
- **Runtime masking**: Process.env is explicitly overridden
- **Unified hydration**: Complete chain from file to UI components
- **Validation gates**: Comprehensive checks ensure consistency

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/dualMountBootstrap.tsx` - Enhanced with forced hydration and Zustand sync
2. `src/state/EnvironmentStore.ts` - Added last-mile guards and hydration status

## Commit Message
```
[P2.02.14] hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand — unify forced hydration and runtime resolution chain
```

## Tag
```
patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand
```

## Summary
✅ **Hydration sync lock complete. Zustand, AppShell, and Bootstrap now resolve file-based environment without fallback. Environment=nextgen is consistent across logs.**

The patch successfully eliminates legacy fallback leaks by implementing a comprehensive hydration chain that ensures a single source of truth for environment state across all application layers.
