**Status**: ✅ PASS  

## Execution Summary

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-31 23:31:06 UTC  
**Duration**: ~5 minutes  
**Target**: DEV  

## Pre-Mutation Validation ✅

- ✅ Original system (gpt-cursor-runner) found and readable
- ✅ Backup directory (_backups) exists and writable  
- ✅ Sufficient disk space available (>1GB free)
- ✅ All required files present (package.json, main.py)

## Backup Creation ✅

- ✅ Created timestamped backup: `gpt-cursor-runner-backup-20250731_233106.tar.gz`
- ✅ Backup size: 62MB (compressed)
- ✅ Used default exclusions (.git, node_modules, __pycache__, *.pyc, .DS_Store, *.log)
- ✅ Generated backup manifest with file listing
- ✅ Backup integrity test passed (successful restore test)

## Post-Mutation Validation ✅

- ✅ Backup file exists and accessible
- ✅ Restore test completed successfully
- ✅ File count validation: Original 36,128 files → Backup 4,697 files (exclusions working correctly)
- ✅ Backup manifest created with timestamp

## Files Created/Modified

- `_backups/gpt-cursor-runner-backup-20250731_233106.tar.gz` (62MB)
- `_backups/backup-manifest-20250731_233106.txt` (manifest)

## Validation Results

**TypeScript**: N/A (backup operation)  
**ESLint**: N/A (backup operation)  
**Runtime**: ✅ Backup restore test passed  
**Performance**: ✅ 62MB backup created efficiently  

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with **Patch 0.2: Clone Directory Structure** as the backup provides a safe foundation for commercial development.

## Notes

- Backup excludes development artifacts as intended
- File count difference is expected due to exclusions
- Backup is fully restorable and validated
- System ready for commercial clone operations
