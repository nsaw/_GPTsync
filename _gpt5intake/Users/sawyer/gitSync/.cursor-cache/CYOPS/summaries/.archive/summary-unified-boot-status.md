# Unified Boot Status Summary

**Date**: Sun Aug 3 15:20:43 PDT 2025  
**Patch ID**: unified-boot-status  
**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS  

## ✅ Successfully Started Services

### Fly.io Deployment
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **URL**: https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/
- **Health**: ✅ Healthy and responding

### Core Services
- **Dashboard Uplink**: ✅ Running and healthy
- **BRAUN Daemon**: ✅ Running and healthy (MAIN patch processing)
- **Patch Executor**: ✅ Running and healthy (unified MAIN/CYOPS processing)
- **Summary Watcher**: ✅ Running and healthy

### Watchdog Services
- **BRAUN Daemon Watchdog**: ✅ Started
- **Patch Executor Watchdog**: ✅ Started (CRITICAL SERVICE)
- **Summary Watcher Watchdog**: ✅ Started
- **Dashboard Uplink Watchdog**: ✅ Started
- **Tunnel Watchdog**: ✅ Started (CRITICAL - External Access)
- **Webhook-thoughtmarks Server**: ✅ Started (CRITICAL - Webhook Service)

## ❌ Failed to Start Services

### Critical Services
- **Flask App (Port 5555)**: ❌ Port occupied by processes 55915, 55928
- **Ghost Runner (Port 5053)**: ❌ Process not running after 3 attempts
- **Comprehensive Dashboard (Port 3002)**: ❌ Health check passed but process failed
- **Dual Monitor Server (Port 8787)**: ❌ Process not running after 3 attempts
- **Command Queue Daemon**: ❌ Process not running after 3 attempts

## 🔧 Issues Identified

### Port Conflicts
- Port 5555 is persistently occupied by Flask App processes
- These processes are being killed but immediately restarting

### Process Startup Issues
- Several Node.js services are failing to start properly
- Health checks are passing but processes are terminating immediately

## 📋 Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Flask App processes** on port 5555 - they keep restarting
2. **Check Node.js service logs** for startup failures
3. **Verify service dependencies** and startup order
4. **Review process management** and PID file handling

### Service Recovery
1. **Flask App**: Need to identify what's auto-restarting the processes
2. **Ghost Runner**: Check Node.js dependencies and startup script
3. **Dashboard Services**: Verify port availability and service configuration
4. **Command Queue**: Review daemon script and dependencies

## 🎯 Current System State

### Working Components
- ✅ Fly.io deployment is live and healthy
- ✅ Core patch processing (BRAUN + Patch Executor) is operational
- ✅ Summary watching and dashboard uplink are functional
- ✅ All watchdog services are monitoring

### Non-Working Components
- ❌ Local Flask webhook endpoint (falling back to Fly.io)
- ❌ Ghost Runner for patch execution
- ❌ Local dashboard services
- ❌ Command queue processing

## 📊 Overall Assessment

**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS (60% operational)

The core patch processing system is working, but the local webhook and dashboard services need attention. The Fly.io deployment provides a working fallback for webhook functionality.

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Core functionality is working, but local services need fixing for full redundancy.
