# Dashboard Process Detection Fixes - Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the dashboard process detection issue where services were incorrectly showing as "stopped" even though they were actually running. This included both local and public dashboard fixes.

## Root Cause
The dashboard system had **multiple data sources** with inconsistent process name mappings:

1. **Flask app** (`gpt_cursor_runner/main.py`) - Used correct process names
2. **Dashboard app** (`dashboard/app.py`) - Had incorrect expected process names
3. **Dual monitor server** (`scripts/monitor/dual-monitor-server.js`) - Used incorrect process mappings
4. **Public dashboard** - Served by dual-monitor-server on port 8787 via Cloudflare tunnel

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Flask Process Detection
**Problem**: Flask app was looking for `'python.*app.py'` but actual process is `'gpt_cursor_runner.main'`
**Solution**: 
- Updated process list to use `'gpt_cursor_runner.main'` instead of `'python.*app.py'`
- Added special handling for Flask app detection to always report as "running" since the API is responding

### 2. Fixed Ghost Bridge Process Detection
**Problem**: API was looking for `'ghost-bridge-watchdog'` but actual process is `'ghost-bridge-simple.js'`
**Solution**:
- Updated process list to use `'ghost-bridge-simple.js'` instead of `'ghost-bridge-watchdog'`
- Updated process name mapping to map `'ghost-bridge-simple.js'` to `'ghost-bridge'`

### 3. Fixed Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard Detection
**Problem**: Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard were showing warning signs (⚠️) because they were missing from the monitored processes list
**Solution**:
- Added `'summary_watcher_daemon.py'` and `'dashboard_daemon.py'` to the processes list
- Added process name mappings:
  - `'summary_watcher_daemon.py'` → `'summary-watcher'`
  - `'dashboard_daemon.py'` → `'comprehensive-dashboard'`

### 4. Fixed Public Dashboard Process Mappings
**Problem**: Public dashboard (served by dual-monitor-server) was using incorrect process mappings
**Solution**:
- Updated `scripts/monitor/dual-monitor-server.js`:
  - `'summary-monitor': 'summary_watcher_daemon.py'` (was `'summary-watcher.js'`)
  - `'ghost-bridge': 'ghost-bridge-simple.js'` (was `'ghost-bridge-watchdog'`)
  - `'comprehensive-dashboard': 'dashboard_daemon.py'` (was `'scripts/core/comprehensive-dashboard.js'`)

### 5. Fixed Dashboard App Expected Processes
**Problem**: `dashboard/app.py` expected `"summary-monitor"` but actual process is `"summary-watcher"`
**Solution**:
- Updated `expected_processes` list in `dashboard/app.py`:
  - Changed `"summary-monitor"` to `"summary-watcher"`

### 6. Updated Process Name Mappings
**Changes Made**:
```python
# Before
process_to_component = {
    'ghost-bridge-watchdog': 'ghost-bridge',
    'python.*app.py': 'flask'
}

# After  
process_to_component = {
    'ghost-bridge-simple.js': 'ghost-bridge',
    'gpt_cursor_runner.main': 'flask',
    'summary_watcher_daemon.py': 'summary-watcher',
    'dashboard_daemon.py': 'comprehensive-dashboard'
}
```

### 7. Added Special Flask Detection Logic
**Added**:
```python
# Special handling for Flask app - if this code is running, Flask is up
if process == 'gpt_cursor_runner.main':
    component_name = process_to_component.get(process, process)
    daemon_status[component_name] = 'running'
    continue
```

## Files Modified

  - Added special Flask app detection
  - Added missing Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard processes

- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/dashboard/app.py`
  - Updated `expected_processes` list to use correct process names
  - Changed `"summary-monitor"` to `"summary-watcher"`

- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/monitor/dual-monitor-server.js`
  - Updated process mappings for public dashboard
  - Fixed `summary-monitor` and `comprehensive-dashboard` mappings

## Current Status
✅ **All services now showing as "running" on both local and public dashboards**:

### Local Dashboard (http://localhost:5555)
- summary-watcher: running ✅ **FIXED**
- comprehensive-dashboard: running ✅ **FIXED**

### Public Dashboard (https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app)
- summary-monitor: running ✅ **FIXED**
- comprehensive-dashboard: running ✅ **FIXED**

### All Other Services
- alert-engine: running
- autonomous-decision-daemon: running  
- braun: running
- doc-daemon: running
- enhanced-doc-daemon: running
- flask: running
- ghost-bridge: running
- ghost-runner: running
- metrics-aggregator-daemon: running
- patch-executor: running
- telemetry-orchestrator: running

## Testing
- ✅ **Local API**: `curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/status | jq '.daemon_status."summary-watcher"'` returns `"running"`
- ✅ **Local API**: `curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/status | jq '.daemon_status."comprehensive-dashboard"'` returns `"running"`
- ✅ **Public API**: `curl -s https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/api/status | jq '.daemon_status."summary-monitor"'` returns `"running"`
- ✅ **Public API**: `curl -s https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/api/status | jq '.daemon_status."comprehensive-dashboard"'` returns `"running"`
- ✅ **Process Verification**: Both `summary_watcher_daemon.py` and `dashboard_daemon.py` confirmed running via `pgrep`

## Warning Signs Resolved
- ✅ Summary Watcher: No longer shows ⚠️ warning sign on public dashboard
- ✅ Comprehensive Dashboard: No longer shows ⚠️ warning sign on public dashboard

## Architecture Understanding
The dashboard system uses **two separate servers**:
1. **Flask App** (port 5555) - Serves local dashboard and API endpoints
2. **Dual Monitor Server** (port 8787) - Serves public dashboard via Cloudflare tunnel

Both servers needed to be updated with correct process mappings to resolve the warning signs.

## Next Steps
The dashboard at https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor should now display correct status information for all services, including Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard without any warning signs.
