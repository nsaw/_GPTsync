# Dashboard Warning Signs and Path Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Fixed Warning Signs for Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard

**Problem**: The dashboard at https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor was showing warning signs (⚠️) for Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard even though the services were running.

**Root Cause**: There was a mismatch between the frontend component names and the API response keys:
- Frontend expected: `'summary-watcher'` and `'dashboard-daemon'`
- API was returning: `'summary-monitor'` and `'comprehensive-dashboard'`

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Updated dual-monitor-server.js process mappings**:
   - Changed `'summary-monitor'` → `'summary-watcher'`
   - Changed `'comprehensive-dashboard'` → `'dashboard-daemon'`
   - Updated all references in agent status sections

2. **Updated process detection logic**:
   - `'summary-watcher'` maps to `'summary_watcher_daemon.py'`
   - `'dashboard-daemon'` maps to `'dashboard_daemon.py'`

3. **Restarted dual-monitor-server** to apply changes

**Result**: Both services now show as "running" on the public dashboard.

### 2. 🔄 MAIN Agent Unified Paths - Partially Resolved

**Problem**: The MAIN Agent watcher wasn't picking up the correct unified paths for patches/summaries/execution history.

**Root Cause**: The dashboard was only looking for `.json` files directly in the patches directory, but patches are organized in subdirectories like `phase-1_complete/`.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Updated dual-monitor-server.js to recursively search subdirectories**:
   - Added `getAllPatchFiles()` function to search recursively
   - Updated patch status detection to include subdirectories
   - Added status categorization based on directory names

2. **Verified unified paths are correct**:
   - MAIN patches: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`
   - MAIN summaries: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`
   - BRAUN daemon correctly uses unified paths

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Warning signs resolved
- 🔄 Patch discovery logic updated but needs testing
- ✅ Unified paths are correctly configured

## Technical Details

### Process Detection Fixes
```javascript
// Before
'summary-monitor': 'summary_watcher_daemon.py',
'comprehensive-dashboard': 'dashboard_daemon.py'

// After  
'summary-watcher': 'summary_watcher_daemon.py',
'dashboard-daemon': 'dashboard_daemon.py'
```

### Recursive Patch Search
```javascript
const getAllPatchFiles = (dir) => {
  const files = [];
  const items = fs.readdirSync(dir);
  
  for (const item of items) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, item);
    const stat = fs.statSync(fullPath);
    
    if (stat.isDirectory() && !item.startsWith('.')) {
      // Recursively search subdirectories
      files.push(...getAllPatchFiles(fullPath));
    } else if (item.endsWith('.json') && !item.startsWith('.')) {
      files.push(fullPath);
    }
  }
  
  return files;
};
```

## Verification

### API Status Check
```bash
curl -s https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/api/daemon-status | jq '.daemon_status | {summary_watcher: ."summary-watcher", dashboard_daemon: ."dashboard-daemon"}'
# Result: Both show "running"
```

### Process Verification
```bash
pgrep -f "summary_watcher_daemon.py"  # ✅ Running
pgrep -f "dashboard_daemon.py"        # ✅ Running
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test patch discovery**: Verify that the recursive search is finding patches in subdirectories
2. **Monitor dashboard**: Confirm that the warning signs remain resolved
3. **Validate unified paths**: Ensure all systems are using the correct unified cache paths

## Files Modified

- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/monitor/dual-monitor-server.js`
  - Updated process mappings
  - Added recursive patch search
  - Fixed component name references

## Summary

The primary issue of warning signs for Summary Watcher and Comprehensive Dashboard has been **completely resolved**. The MAIN Agent unified paths issue has been **partially resolved** with the recursive search implementation, but requires further testing to confirm patch discovery is working correctly.

**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED** - Dashboard warning signs fixed, unified paths configured correctly.
