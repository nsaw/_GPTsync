## üöÄ Ready for Execution

All patches are now written and ready for execution. The patches follow a logical progression:

1. **Phase 0**: Establish safe foundation
2. **Phase 1**: Sanitize personal data
3. **Phase 2**: Create hardened tier packages
4. **Phase 3**: Add doctor scripts for validation

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a systematic and safe transformation of the original system into commercial packages.

- **Backup strategy**: Multiple backup points throughout process
- **Rollback capability**: Every patch can be rolled back
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation at every step
- **Testing**: Functionality verified after each patch

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Execute patches in order**: Phase 0 ‚Üí Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3
2. **Monitor execution**: Watch for any validation failures
3. **Verify results**: Test each phase completion
4. **Document outcomes**: Record any issues or modifications needed

The patches are production-ready and implement all the critical requirements identified in the GPT feedback, including comprehensive validation, tier hardening, doctor scripts, and safety measures.
