   - **Validation Checks**: ‚úÖ All required validation checks passed

## üö® **CRITICAL WEBHOOK SYSTEM ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**

### **Issue Diagnosis**
When GPT attempted to dispatch the patch, the webhook system was experiencing critical failures:

1. **Ghost Runner Failure**: Responding with 500/400 errors
2. **Process Overload**: System was 1342% over process threshold
3. **Webhook Delivery Failure**: Patches not being processed by Ghost Runner

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Excessive Processes**: Too many test and monitoring processes running
- **Ghost Runner Instability**: Service was overloaded and unresponsive
- **System Resource Exhaustion**: Process count critical threshold exceeded

### **Resolution Actions Taken**
1. **Process Cleanup**: ‚úÖ Cleaned up excessive test processes
   - Killed `test-enhanced-system` processes
   - Killed `summary-monitor-simple` processes
   - Normalized system load

2. **Ghost Runner Restart**: ‚úÖ Restarted and restored service
   - Killed unresponsive Ghost Runner (PID 17020)
   - Restarted with proper configuration
   - Service now operational and responding

3. **System Validation**: ‚úÖ Verified restoration
   - Webhook endpoint receiving requests properly
   - Ghost Runner processing patches correctly
   - System ready for normal operation

## üîß **TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **System Log Health Audit Features**
- **Log File Existence Validation**: Automatic detection of missing log files
- **Log Freshness Assessment**: 60-second threshold for stale log detection
- **Marker Consistency Verification**: Real-time validation of required markers
