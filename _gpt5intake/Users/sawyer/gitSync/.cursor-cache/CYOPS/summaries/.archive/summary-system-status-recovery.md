# Summary: System Status Recovery

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-23 UTC  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS  
**Task:** Recover stale patch status, system status, and ghost runners

## üö® Issues Identified

### ‚ùå Current Problems
1. **Patch Status Stale** - No recent updates in dual monitor
2. **No System Status** - Systems section empty in monitor output
3. **Ghost Runners Down** - Both MAIN and CYOPS show "‚ùå UNKNOWN" status

### üìä Dual Monitor Output Analysis
```
üì¶ PATCH STATUS:
   [ MAIN ] Pending: 2 | Executing: 0 | Completed: 31 | Failed: 0
   [ CYOPS ] Pending: 0 | Executing: 0 | Completed: 21 | Failed: 0
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Pending patches detected!

üîÑ EXECUTION QUEUE:
   [ MAIN ]
   ‚è≥ atch-v1.4.40(P1.00.25)_topbar-zone-shell-link.json (queued)
   ‚è≥ test-patch.json (queued)
   [ CYOPS ]
   ‚úÖ No pending patches in queue

üñ•Ô∏è  SYSTEM STATUS:
   [ MAIN ] (empty)
   [ CYOPS ] (empty)

üëª GHOST RUNNER STATUS:
   [ MAIN ] ‚ùå UNKNOWN
   [ CYOPS ] ‚ùå UNKNOWN

```

## üîß Recovery Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Services Launched
1. **Launch Script Executed** - `./scripts/launch-all-systems.sh`
2. **Ghost Runner Started** - `python3 -m gpt_cursor_runner.main --port 5051`
3. **Patch Executor Started** - `node scripts/patch-executor.js`
4. **Ghost Bridge Started** - `node scripts/ghost-bridge.js`

### ‚úÖ Non-blocking Patterns Used
- All services launched with `nohup` + `disown` + log redirection
- Proper background execution to prevent terminal blocking
- Log files created for debugging

## üìù Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Service Health** - Check if launched services are actually running
2. **Check Log Files** - Review logs for startup errors or issues
3. **Test Health Endpoints** - Verify ghost runner and other services respond
4. **Restart Dual Monitor** - Ensure monitor picks up new service status

### Service Verification
```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(ghost|braun|cyops|patch-executor)"

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:5051/health
curl http://localhost:7474/ghost

# Check logs
tail -10 logs/ghost-runner.log
tail -10 logs/patch-executor.log
tail -10 logs/ghost-bridge.log
```

### Expected Status After Recovery
- **Ghost Runners**: ‚úÖ Running (MAIN and CYOPS)
- **System Status**: ‚úÖ Populated with running services
- **Patch Status**: ‚úÖ Updated with current queue status
- **Health Checks**: ‚úÖ All endpoints responding

## üö® Current Status

- **Services Launched**: ‚úÖ Attempted (ghost-runner, patch-executor, ghost-bridge)
- **Process Verification**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to confirm services are actually running
- **Health Endpoints**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test if services are responding
- **Dual Monitor**: ‚ö†Ô∏è May need restart to pick up new status

**Recovery actions initiated. Need to verify services are actually running and responding to health checks.**

## üìã Recovery Checklist

- [ ] Verify ghost-runner process is running
- [ ] Verify patch-executor process is running  
- [ ] Verify ghost-bridge process is running
- [ ] Test health endpoints (localhost:5051/health)
- [ ] Check dual monitor picks up new status
- [ ] Verify system status shows running services
- [ ] Confirm patch status updates correctly
