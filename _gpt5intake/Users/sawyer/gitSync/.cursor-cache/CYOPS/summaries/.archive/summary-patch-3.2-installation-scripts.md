**Patch ID**: `patch-v1.0.0(P3.2.01)_installation-scripts`  
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**  
**Phase**: 3  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-01  

## Overview
Successfully created hardened, anti-terminal-blocking installation scripts for all ThoughtPilot tiers with timeout protection and background execution.

## Files Created
- `installation-scripts/install-base.sh` - Base installation template with hardened patterns
- `installation-scripts/install-free.sh` - Free tier installation script
- `installation-scripts/install-pro.sh` - Pro tier installation script
- `installation-scripts/install-team.sh` - Team tier installation script
- `installation-scripts/install-enterprise.sh` - Enterprise tier installation script
- `installation-scripts/install.sh` - Universal installation script
- `installation-scripts/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Installation documentation

## Features Implemented
- **Non-blocking Operations**: All heavy operations run in background with timeouts
- **CI/CD Safe**: No process will hang your pipeline or terminal
- **Timeout Protection**: Every operation has appropriate timeout limits
  - Doctor scripts: 45 seconds
  - Python dependencies: 120 seconds
  - Node.js dependencies: 120 seconds
  - Python tests: 60 seconds
  - Node.js tests: 60 seconds
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All output captured to logs/ directory
- **Tier-Specific**: Each tier has its own installation script
- **Universal Interface**: Single install.sh script with TIER parameter

## Validation Results
- ✅ All 6 installation scripts created successfully
- ✅ All scripts have proper executable permissions
- ✅ All scripts pass syntax validation
- ✅ Installation guide created with usage examples
- ✅ Hardened patterns implemented for CI/CD safety

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Install specific tier
bash install-free.sh
bash install-pro.sh
bash install-team.sh
bash install-enterprise.sh

# Or use universal installer
TIER=pro bash install.sh
```

## Log Files Generated
- `doctor.log` - System health check results
- `pip-install.log` - Python dependency installation
- `npm-install.log` - Node.js dependency installation
- `pytest.log` - Python test results
- `npm-test.log` - Node.js test results

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with `patch-3.1-free-tier-bundle.json` which creates the Free tier bundle.

## Technical Notes
- All scripts use `timeout` and `disown` patterns for terminal safety
- Background execution prevents pipeline hanging
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Tier-specific directory navigation and configuration
