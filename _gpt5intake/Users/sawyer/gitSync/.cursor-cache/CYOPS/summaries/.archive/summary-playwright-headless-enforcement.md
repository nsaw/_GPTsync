# Summary: Playwright Headless Green-State Enforcement

**Patch ID**: patch-v1.1.41(P4.04.21)_dashboard-playwright-headless.yaml  
**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Agent**: DEV/CYOPS  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-02 00:45 UTC  

## Overview
Successfully enforced Playwright headless E2E validation of dashboard green-state. The test now runs headless by default in CI/CD environments and fails immediately if ANY `.status-indicator` is not green (status-ok). Configuration optimized for automated pipelines with clear output and environment variable support.

## Completed Steps

### 1. ✅ Dependencies Verification
- **Action**: Ensured Playwright and @playwright/test are installed
- **Command**: `yarn add --dev playwright @playwright/test`
- **Result**: Dependencies confirmed and up to date
- **Browsers**: Reinstalled with `yarn playwright install --with-deps`

### 2. ✅ Canonical E2E Test File Updated
- **File**: `tests/dashboard/all-green.test.js`
- **Improvements**:
  - Simplified test logic using `$$eval` for better performance
  - Improved timeout handling (30s page load, 15s selector wait)
  - Direct class validation with `expect(cls).toContain('status-ok')`
  - Cleaner error reporting without manual failure collection
- **Functionality**: Fails immediately on any non-green status indicator

### 3. ✅ Playwright Configuration Optimized
- **File**: `playwright.config.js`
- **Changes**:
  - **Headless by default**: `use: { headless: true }`
  - **No retries**: `retries: 0` for immediate failure
  - **60s timeout**: `timeout: 60000` for CI/CD environments
  - **Simplified config**: Removed complex multi-browser setup for focused validation
- **Result**: Optimized for automated pipeline execution

### 4. ✅ Package.json Script Updated
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Script**: `"test:dashboard": "playwright test tests/dashboard/all-green.test.js"`
- **Improvements**:
  - Removed redundant timeout parameter (handled in config)
  - Simplified command structure
  - Direct playwright CLI usage
- **Usage**: `yarn test:dashboard`

### 5. ✅ Documentation Updated
- **File**: `README.md`
- **Content**: Streamlined documentation focused on headless usage
- **Features**:
  - Clear usage instructions
  - Environment variable configuration
  - CI/CD integration guidance
  - Headless mode emphasis

## Test Validation Results

### ✅ Headless Execution Verified
- **Command**: `yarn test:dashboard`
- **Result**: Test executes successfully in headless mode
- **Validation**: Correctly detects and fails on non-green status indicators
- **Output**: Clean, CI-friendly output without browser UI

### ✅ Failure Detection Working
The test properly fails when dashboard has non-green blocks:
```
Error: expect(received).toContain(expected)
Expected substring: "status-ok"
Received string: "status-indicator"
```
This demonstrates:
- Correct element detection
- Proper class validation
- Immediate failure on non-green status
- Clean error reporting

### ✅ Configuration Validation
- **Headless mode**: Confirmed working without browser UI
- **Timeout handling**: 60s global timeout properly applied
- **No retries**: Immediate failure as configured
- **Environment variables**: DASHBOARD_URL support verified

## Technical Implementation

### Optimized Test Structure
```javascript
test('Dashboard must be all green', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(DASHBOARD_URL, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 });
  await page.waitForSelector('.status-indicator', { timeout: 15000 });
  const statuses = await page.$$eval('.status-indicator', els => els.map(e => e.className));
  // Fail on any non-green
  statuses.forEach((cls, idx) => {
    expect(cls).toContain('status-ok');
  });
});
```

### Headless Configuration
```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  use: { headless: true },
  retries: 0,
  timeout: 60000,
});
```

## Usage Instructions

### Local Development
```bash
# Run headless dashboard validation
yarn test:dashboard

# Run with custom dashboard URL
DASHBOARD_URL=https://your-url yarn test:dashboard

# List available tests
yarn playwright test tests/dashboard/all-green.test.js --list
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Dashboard Green-State Validation
  run: yarn test:dashboard
  env:
    DASHBOARD_URL: ${{ secrets.DASHBOARD_URL }}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ CI/CD Optimized
