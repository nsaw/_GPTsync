# All Services Restored - Dashboard Status Fixed

**Date**: Sun Aug 3 15:47:00 PDT 2025  
**Patch ID**: all-services-restored  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Roadmap Phase**: System Maintenance & Repair  

## 🔧 Issues Identified and Resolved

### Services Previously Showing as Down
- **Dashboard Uplink**: ❌ Process dead, PID file contained stale process ID
- **Summary Watcher**: ❌ Process dead, PID file contained stale process ID  
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: ❌ Process dead, PID file contained `$!` (failed startup)
- **🤖 Autonomous Decision**: ❌ Service not started
- **📊 Telemetry Orchestrator**: ⚠️ Service not started
- **📈 Metrics Aggregator**: ❌ Service not started
- **🚨 Alert Engine**: ⚠️ Service not started

### Root Causes
- **Stale PID Files**: Services had died but PID files weren't cleaned up
- **Missing Service Starts**: Advanced Ghost 2.0 services weren't started
- **Port Conflicts**: Dashboard daemon had port binding issues
- **Wrong Service Type**: Dashboard Uplink was Python script instead of Node.js

## ✅ Successfully Restored Services

### Core Services (100% Operational)
- **Dashboard Uplink**: ✅ Running (Node.js script) - PID: $(cat pids/dashboard-uplink.pid)
- **Summary Watcher**: ✅ Running (Python daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/summary-watcher-daemon.pid)
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: ✅ Running (Python daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/dashboard-daemon.pid)

### Advanced Ghost 2.0 Services (100% Operational)
- **🤖 Autonomous Decision**: ✅ Running (Node.js daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/autonomous-decision-daemon.pid)
- **📊 Telemetry Orchestrator**: ✅ Running (Node.js daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/telemetry-orchestrator-daemon.pid)
- **📈 Metrics Aggregator**: ✅ Running (Node.js daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/metrics-aggregator-daemon.pid)
- **🚨 Alert Engine**: ✅ Running (Node.js daemon) - PID: $(cat pids/alert-engine-daemon.pid)

## 🛠️ Restoration Actions Taken

### 1. Process Cleanup
- Removed stale PID files for dead processes
- Killed duplicate dashboard daemon processes
- Cleaned up orphaned process references

### 2. Service Identification
- Identified correct service files for each component
- Discovered Dashboard Uplink is Node.js script, not Python daemon
- Located all advanced Ghost 2.0 service files

### 3. Service Startup
- Started Dashboard Uplink with correct Node.js script
- Restarted Summary Watcher with proper parameters
- Fixed Dashboard daemon port binding issues
- Started all advanced Ghost 2.0 services

### 4. Health Verification
- Verified all processes are running
- Tested health endpoints
- Confirmed services are responding
