## Execution Status: ✅ PASS

## Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `src-nextgen/ghost/telemetry/ghostAlertEngine.ts`

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Intelligent Alert Rules**: Configurable rules with conditions, actions, and escalation policies
2. **Multi-channel Notifications**: Slack, email, webhook, SMS, and PagerDuty support
3. **Escalation Policies**: Multi-level escalation with configurable delays and actions
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous rule evaluation every 10 seconds
5. **Alert Management**: Active alert tracking with acknowledgment and resolution
6. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits for notification channels
7. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed actions
8. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time alert status and history delivery

### Key Components
- **AlertRule Interface**: Defines alert rules with conditions, actions, and escalation policies
- **AlertCondition Interface**: Threshold, trend, anomaly, absence, and presence conditions
- **AlertAction Interface**: Notification, webhook, command, escalation, and automation actions
- **EscalationPolicy Interface**: Multi-level escalation with configurable delays
- **AlertEvent Interface**: Alert instances with status tracking and action results
- **NotificationChannel Interface**: Channel configuration with rate limiting

### Default Alert Rules
1. **High CPU Usage**: Triggers when CPU usage exceeds 80% for 5+ minutes
2. **Daemon Failure**: Triggers when daemon health ratio drops below 80%
3. **High Response Time**: Triggers when average response time exceeds 5 seconds

### Notification Channels
- **Slack**: Webhook-based notifications with configurable channels and usernames
- **Email**: SMTP-based email notifications (configurable via environment variables)
- **Webhook**: HTTP POST notifications to external systems
- **SMS**: SMS notifications (placeholder for future implementation)
- **PagerDuty**: PagerDuty integration (placeholder for future implementation)

### Escalation Policies
- **Level 1 (5 minutes)**: Team notification via Slack
- **Level 2 (15 minutes)**: Team and leadership notification via Slack and email
- **Level 3 (30 minutes)**: Emergency notification via Slack, email, and SMS

### Alert Conditions
- **Threshold**: Numeric comparisons (gt, lt, eq, ne, gte, lte)
- **Trend**: Trend analysis with confidence scoring
- **Anomaly**: Deviation from baseline detection
- **Absence**: Missing data or service detection
- **Presence**: Service or data availability detection

### Alert Actions
- **Notification**: Send alerts to configured channels
- **Webhook**: HTTP POST to external systems
- **Command**: Execute system commands or scripts
- **Escalation**: Trigger escalation policy
- **Automation**: Automated response actions (placeholder)

### Configuration Options
- **Monitoring**: 10-second intervals, 50 max concurrent alerts, 5-minute timeout
- **Rules**: 100 max rules, 30-second evaluation interval, 10-second condition timeout
- **Notifications**: Rate limiting enabled, message templates, default channels
- **Escalation**: Auto-escalation, 5-minute timeout, 5 max escalation levels
- **Integration**: Dashboard updates every 10 seconds, telemetry integration
- **Security**: Authorization, audit logging, authentication (optional)

### Technical Implementation
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **File-based Storage**: JSON state files with automatic persistence
- **Memory Management**: Configurable history limits (10K alerts, 100 active alerts)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Efficient rule evaluation with configurable intervals

### Alert Lifecycle
1. **Rule Evaluation**: Continuous evaluation of all enabled rules
2. **Condition Checking**: Metric data retrieval and condition evaluation
3. **Alert Triggering**: Alert creation with action execution
4. **Action Execution**: Notification, webhook, command, or escalation actions
5. **Status Tracking**: Active, acknowledged, resolved, or escalated status
6. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of resolved alerts

### Integration Points
- **Metrics Aggregator**: Retrieves metric data for condition evaluation
- **Dashboard**: Sends alert status and history for visualization
- **Telemetry**: Sends alert metrics and events for analysis
- **File System**: State persistence and configuration management
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging to `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/logs/alert-engine.log`

### Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents notification spam with configurable limits
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for alert management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all alert operations
- **Authentication**: Optional authentication for alert management
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic sanitization of sensitive data

### Performance Optimizations
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents alert spam with configurable cooldowns
- **Max Triggers**: Limits alert frequency with maximum trigger counts
- **Efficient Evaluation**: Optimized rule evaluation with early termination
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old alerts and history
- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable limits for concurrent alert processing

## Validation Results
- ✅ File creation successful
- ✅ Class implementation complete
- ✅ Core methods implemented (evaluateRule, triggerAlert, executeAction)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All validation checks passed
- ✅ Error handling implemented

## Storage Management
- **State File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/telemetry/alert-engine-state.json`
- **Config File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/config/alert-engine-config.json`
- **Log File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/logs/alert-engine.log`
- **Escalation Directory**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/telemetry/escalations/`

## Next Steps
