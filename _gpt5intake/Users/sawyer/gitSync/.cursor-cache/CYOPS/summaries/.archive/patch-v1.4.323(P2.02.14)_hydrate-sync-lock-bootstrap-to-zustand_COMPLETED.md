# PATCH EXECUTION COMPLETED ✅

## Patch: patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand

### Execution Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

### Pre-Commit Actions ✅
- [x] Backup created: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_backups/20250721_UTC_v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand_backup_tm-mobile-cursor.tar.gz`
- [x] Environment set to development
- [x] Bootstrap patch execution started

### Mutations Applied ✅
1. **dualMountBootstrap.tsx** - Enhanced with forced process.env override, Zustand sync, and AppShell state resolution
2. **EnvironmentStore.ts** - Added last-mile guard, hydration status, and AppShell fallback resolver

### Post-Mutation Validation ✅
- [x] TypeScript compilation issues resolved (fixed import statement in variants.ts)
- [x] Lint issues addressed (removed unused variables, fixed import order)
- [x] Runtime validation passed with comprehensive log evidence

### Runtime Validation Results ✅

#### Critical Success Indicators Confirmed:
```
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: EnvironmentStore hydrated nextgen from file
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: AppShell: Environment is nextgen (source: file)
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: AppShell: Confirmed nextgen environment from file
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: All hydration checks passed - environment=nextgen
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: Explicitly overrode process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT to nextgen
✅ FORCED HYDRATION: EnvironmentStore last-mile guard overrode process.env to nextgen
```

#### Validation Requirements Met:
- [x] Forced hydration trace includes `✅ EnvironmentStore hydrated nextgen from file`
- [x] AppShell log resolves to 'nextgen' without fallback
- [x] No runtime logs show 'legacy' as resolved state after hydration
- [x] Process.env explicitly overridden for runtime masking
- [x] All logs show environment=nextgen or source=file
- [x] Theme + Auth hydration follows environment init

### Git Operations ✅
- [x] Commit created: `[P2.02.14] hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand — unify forced hydration and runtime resolution chain`
- [x] Tag created: `patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand`
- [x] Summary file created: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/patch-v1.4.323(P2.02.14)_hydrate-sync-lock-bootstrap-to-zustand.md`

### Technical Achievement ✅

#### Problem Solved:
- **Legacy fallback leak eliminated**: No more inconsistent environment state
- **Single source of truth established**: env.app file is authoritative
- **Runtime consistency guaranteed**: Process.env explicitly overridden
- **Unified hydration chain**: Complete flow from file to UI components

#### Implementation Highlights:
- **7 comprehensive hydration checks** including processEnvOverride, zustandSync, and appShellResolution
- **Last-mile guards** ensure runtime consistency
- **AppShell fallback resolver** with enhanced logic
- **State verification** validates consistency across all layers

### Final Status ✅
**PATCH EXECUTION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The patch successfully eliminates legacy fallback leaks by implementing a comprehensive hydration chain that ensures a single source of truth for environment state across all application layers. All validation requirements have been met and the system now consistently resolves to the nextgen environment without any fallback leaks.

**Environment=nextgen is now consistent across all logs and application layers.**
