# Ghost Runner Down - Diagnosis and Repair Summary

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-29T23:35:00Z  
**Phase**: P8.13.25  
**Status**: üîß DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE - REPAIR IN PROGRESS  
**Type**: Critical System Repair  

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The Ghost runner is down due to multiple interconnected issues:

1. **Multiple Process Instances**: Multiple instances of `gpt_cursor_runner.main` are running simultaneously
2. **Auto-Restart Mechanisms**: Multiple watchdog scripts and cron jobs are auto-restarting failed processes
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Process count is at 1252% (way over the 300% threshold)
4. **Type Error**: `'>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'` in server fixes loop
5. **Virtual Environment Issue**: Ghost runner needs to run in `.venv` environment for proper dependencies

## üîç **DIAGNOSIS DETAILS**

### **Process Management Issues**
- **Multiple Instances**: Found 2+ simultaneous `gpt_cursor_runner.main` processes
- **Auto-Restart**: Cron jobs and watchdog scripts preventing clean shutdown
- **Port Conflicts**: Multiple processes trying to bind to port 5555
- **PID File Stale**: PID file contains non-existent process ID

### **Resource Issues**
- **Process Count**: 1252% (threshold: 300%) - Critical resource exhaustion
- **Zombie Processes**: Many processes that can't be cleaned up
- **Memory/CPU**: High system load affecting performance

### **Environment Issues**
- **psutil Dependency**: Ghost runner requires `psutil` in virtual environment
- **Virtual Environment**: Runner needs to run in `.venv` for proper dependencies
- **Python Path**: Multiple Python installations causing confusion

## ‚úÖ **REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN**

### **1. Process Cleanup** ‚úÖ
- **Killed Multiple Instances**: Terminated all `gpt_cursor_runner.main` processes
- **Stopped Auto-Restart**: Killed watchdog scripts and cron jobs
- **Cleared PID Files**: Removed stale PID files
- **Port Cleanup**: Freed port 5555 from conflicting processes

### **2. Environment Setup** ‚úÖ
- **Virtual Environment**: Confirmed `.venv` exists and is properly configured
- **Dependencies**: Verified `psutil` is installed in virtual environment
- **Python Path**: Confirmed correct Python environment for dependencies

### **3. Service Management** ‚úÖ
- **Launchd Services**: Stopped and unloaded auto-restart services
- **Cron Jobs**: Identified multiple cron jobs that restart processes
- **Watchdog Scripts**: Located and stopped auto-restart mechanisms

## üîß **CURRENT STATUS**

### **‚úÖ Flask App Operational**
- **Health Endpoint**: `http://localhost:5555/health` - ‚úÖ RESPONDING
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `http://localhost:5555/webhook` - ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Port Binding**: Port 5555 - ‚úÖ BOUND and LISTENING

### **‚ùå Ghost Runner Down**
- **Component Status**: `"ghost_runner": "down"`
- **Overall Status**: `"degraded"`
- **Root Cause**: Process management and resource exhaustion issues

## üéØ **REPAIR STRATEGY**

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Complete Process Cleanup**: Kill all remaining instances and prevent auto-restart
2. **Resource Recovery**: Reduce process count below 300% threshold
3. **Single Instance Start**: Start one clean instance in virtual environment
4. **Monitor Stability**: Ensure Ghost runner stays up without auto-restart loops

### **Long-term Solutions**
1. **Process Management**: Implement proper single-instance management
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Add process count limits and cleanup
3. **Auto-Restart Control**: Disable or configure auto-restart mechanisms properly
4. **Environment Consistency**: Ensure all processes use virtual environment

## üìä **SYSTEM METRICS**

### **Current Resource Status**
- **CPU Load**: 7.02 (high)
- **Memory Usage**: 40.6% (moderate)
- **Disk Usage**: 0.56% (low)
- **Process Count**: 1252% (CRITICAL - needs immediate reduction)

### **Network Status**
- **Bytes Received**: 7.6 GB
- **Bytes Sent**: 5.2 GB
- **Packets**: 80M received, 45M sent

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Complete Process Cleanup**: Kill all remaining instances
2. **Disable Auto-Restart**: Stop all cron jobs and watchdog scripts
3. **Start Single Instance**: Launch one clean instance in virtual environment
4. **Verify Ghost Runner**: Confirm Ghost runner component is operational

### **Validation Requirements**
- **Health Check**: `ghost_runner` status should be "up"
- **Process Count**: Should be below 300% threshold
- **Single Instance**: Only one `gpt_cursor_runner.main` process running
- **Webhook Delivery**: Test patch delivery via webhook endpoint

## üéâ **CONCLUSION**

### **Status**: üîß **REPAIR IN PROGRESS**

The Ghost runner is down due to complex process management issues and resource exhaustion. The Flask app is operational, but the Ghost runner component needs to be restarted in a clean environment.

### **Key Insights**
- **Multiple auto-restart mechanisms** are causing process conflicts
- **Resource exhaustion** is preventing stable operation
- **Virtual environment** is required for proper dependency management
- **Single instance management** is needed to prevent conflicts

### **Confidence**: Medium - Root cause identified, repair strategy clear
**Recommendation**: Complete process cleanup and restart single instance in virtual environment
