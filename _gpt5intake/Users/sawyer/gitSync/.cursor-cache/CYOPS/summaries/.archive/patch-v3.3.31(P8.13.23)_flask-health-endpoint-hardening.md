# Patch P8.13.23: Flask Health Endpoint Hardening - COMPLETED

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-29T22:58:00Z  
**Phase**: P8.13.23  
**Status**: âœ… PATCH COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Type**: Health Endpoint Hardening and System Liveliness  

## ðŸŽ¯ **PATCH OBJECTIVE**

### **Primary Goal**
Replace the naive "unknown" health status with real-time component validation and system liveliness reporting to ensure reliable webhook endpoint operation.

### **Mission Statement**
Harden the Flask `/health` endpoint with dynamic runtime checks for Ghost runner, port binding, filesystem access, and system metrics to provide actionable health status for GPT and tunnel monitoring.

## âœ… **PATCH EXECUTION RESULTS**

### **1. Health Endpoint Hardening** âœ…
- **File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/main.py`
- **Function**: `health_check()` - Complete replacement with real-time validation
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Ghost runner process detection
  - Port 5555 binding validation
  - Filesystem write permission testing
  - Flask responsiveness confirmation
  - Comprehensive system metrics collection

### **2. Component Validation Logic** âœ…
```python
# Ghost runner check
ghost_found = any("ghost-runner.js" in str(arg) for arg in proc.info['cmdline'])

# Port 5555 check
port_conflict = any(conn.laddr.port == 5555 for conn in psutil.net_connections())

# Filesystem check
with open(test_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write('ok')
os.remove(test_path)
```

### **3. Status Logic Implementation** âœ…
- **Healthy**: No status flags (all components operational)
- **Degraded**: Ghost runner down but other components working
- **Unknown**: Other component issues detected
- **Error**: Exception during health check execution

### **4. System Metrics Collection** âœ…
- **CPU**: Usage percentage, core count, load average
- **Memory**: Total, available, used, percentage
- **Disk**: Total, used, free, percentage
- **Network**: Bytes sent/received, packets sent/received

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Real-Time Component Checks**
- **Ghost Runner Detection**: Scans all processes for `ghost-runner.js` in command line
- **Port Binding Validation**: Checks if port 5555 is bound by any process
- **Filesystem Testing**: Attempts to write and remove a test file in patches directory
- **Flask Responsiveness**: Confirms webhook endpoint is operational

### **Status Determination Logic**
```python
if not status_flags:
    response['overall_status'] = "healthy"
elif "ghost_down" in status_flags:
    response['overall_status'] = "degraded"
else:
    response['overall_status'] = "unknown"
```

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual component failures don't crash the endpoint
- **Fallback Response**: Returns error status with details if health check fails
- **Exception Safety**: All component checks wrapped in try-catch blocks

## ðŸ“Š **VALIDATION RESULTS**

### **âœ… Health Endpoint Response**
```json
{
  "components": {
    "flask_responsive": true,
    "fs_writable": true,
    "ghost_runner": "down",
    "port_5555_bound": false,
    "webhook_endpoint": "operational"
  },
  "overall_status": "degraded",
  "system_metrics": {
    "cpu": { "count": 20, "percent": 16.8 },
    "memory": { "percent": 39.7 },

  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-29T22:58:51.312594",
  "version": "3.1.1"
}
```

### **âœ… Webhook Endpoint Validation**
