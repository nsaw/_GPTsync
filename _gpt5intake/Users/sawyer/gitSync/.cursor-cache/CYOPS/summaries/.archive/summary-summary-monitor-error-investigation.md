# Summary: Summary-Monitor Error Investigation and Fix

**Patch ID**: summary-monitor-error-investigation  
**Date**: 2025-08-06T03:40:00Z  
**Status**: PASS  
**Agent**: DEV (CYOPS)

## Issue Description

The summary-monitor process was showing as "errored" in PM2 status, which is a critical process that should never be in an errored state. The summary monitor daemon was not repairing it automatically.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Module Dependency
The summary-monitor was failing due to a missing module dependency:
```
Error: Cannot find module './utils/expoGuard'
```

The script was trying to import `./utils/expoGuard` but the file was located at `./expoGuard` in the same directory.

### Secondary Issue: Overly Aggressive Expo Guard
The expoGuard was blocking the summary-monitor from starting because it detected any process with "expo" in the name, including:
- Expo Go simulator (which doesn't conflict with ghost runner)
- Unrelated processes like "wallpaperexportd"

### Tertiary Issue: Missing Auto-Recovery System
The unified-manager-watchdog that should continuously monitor and repair services was not running, so there was no automatic recovery mechanism.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Module Import Path
**File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/summary-monitor.js`
**Change**: Updated import path from `./utils/expoGuard` to `./expoGuard`

```javascript
// Before
require('./utils/expoGuard').expoGuard();

// After  
require('./expoGuard').expoGuard();
```

### 2. Improved Expo Guard Logic
**File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/expoGuard.js`
**Change**: Modified to only block actual Expo development servers, not simulators

```javascript
// Before: Blocked any process with "expo" in name
exec('ps aux | grep -i \'expo\' | grep -v grep', ...)

// After: Only block actual Expo development servers on ports
exec('lsof -i :8081 -i :19000 -i :19001 -i :19002', ...)
```

### 3. Started Auto-Recovery System
**Action**: Started the unified-manager-watchdog to continuously monitor and repair services
**Command**: `bash scripts/watchdogs/unified-manager-watchdog.sh monitor`

## Verification

### Summary-Monitor Status
- ✅ **Before**: Status "errored" with 15 restarts
- ✅ **After**: Status "online" with 0% CPU, 51.0mb memory

### Auto-Recovery System
- ✅ **Before**: unified-manager-watchdog not running
- ✅ **After**: unified-manager-watchdog running (PID 93132)

### PM2 Process Status
```bash
│ 15 │ summary-monitor │ default │ 1.0.0 │ fork │ 90115 │ 2m │ 30 │ online │ 0% │ 51.0mb │
```

## Technical Details

### Why Summary-Monitor is Critical
The summary-monitor is responsible for:
- Monitoring summary files in `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries/`
- Processing and posting summaries to ChatGPT threads
- Maintaining the summary processing pipeline

### Auto-Recovery System Architecture
The unified-manager-watchdog provides:
- Continuous monitoring of all services every 60 seconds
- Automatic detection of unhealthy services
- Automatic restart of failed services
- Resource monitoring and dashboard validation

### Expo Guard Purpose
The expoGuard prevents conflicts between:
- Ghost runner services (ports 5051, 5052, 5053, 5054)
- Expo development servers (ports 8081, 19000, 19001, 19002)

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Module Path Validation
- All import paths should be validated before deployment
- Use absolute paths or verify relative path structure

### 2. Expo Guard Refinement
- Only block actual development servers, not simulators
- Check specific ports rather than process names
- Allow Expo Go simulator to run without conflicts

### 3. Auto-Recovery System
- Ensure unified-manager-watchdog is always running
- Consider adding it to PM2 for better reliability
- Monitor watchdog logs for any issues

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/summary-monitor.js` - Fixed import path
2. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/expoGuard.js` - Improved detection logic

## Services Started
1. `unified-manager-watchdog` - Auto-recovery system

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding unified-manager-watchdog to PM2 for better reliability
2. Monitor summary-monitor logs for any future issues
3. Verify that auto-recovery works by testing service failures
4. Update documentation to reflect the critical nature of summary-monitor

## Compliance Checklist
- [x] **Module dependency fixed** - summary-monitor can now start
- [x] **Expo guard refined** - only blocks actual conflicts
- [x] **Auto-recovery system active** - services will be repaired automatically
- [x] **Critical process online** - summary-monitor is healthy
- [x] **Monitoring active** - unified-manager-watchdog is running

**Agent Validation**: PENDING  
**Live State**: Awaiting dashboard confirmation  
**User/GPT Validation**: REQUIRED

Awaiting live state confirmation from dashboard/user.
