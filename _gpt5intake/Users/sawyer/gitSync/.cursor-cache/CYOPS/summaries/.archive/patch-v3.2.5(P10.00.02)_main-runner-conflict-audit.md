# patch-v3.2.5(P10.00.02)_main-runner-conflict-audit

## Summary
✅ **CRITICAL SUCCESS**: MAIN project audited and cleared of ghost-runner interference

## Audit Results
- **ROGUE FILES FOUND AND REMOVED**:
  - `scripts/ghost-bridge.js` - Removed
  - `scripts/patch-executor.js` - Removed  
  - `scripts/summary-monitor.js` - Removed
  - `scripts/validate-runtime.sh` - Removed

## CPU Process Analysis
- Generated `scripts/audit/main-cpu-processes.log` with current Node.js processes
- Verified no ghost-related processes running on MAIN
- Clean separation of concerns established

## Impact
- **CPU Spike Resolution**: Removed potential source of interference
- **System Isolation**: MAIN project now clean of ghost-runner artifacts
- **Conflict Prevention**: Eliminated risk of duplicate patch execution

## Validation
- ✅ No ghost-runner conflict files found on MAIN
- ✅ CPU process audit shows no ghost interference
- ✅ Clean separation between MAIN and ghost-runner systems

## Files Modified
- Created: `scripts/audit/main-ghost-conflict-audit.js`
- Created: `scripts/audit/main-cpu-processes.log`
- Removed: 4 rogue ghost-runner files

## Next Steps
