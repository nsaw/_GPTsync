## 🔧 **Issues Resolved**

### **Original Problem**
- ❌ Master test runner couldn't find individual test suite scripts
- ❌ Inconsistent naming conventions across test suites
- ❌ Scripts looking for `run-*.sh` but actual files had different names

### **Solution Applied**
- ✅ Updated master runner to handle multiple naming conventions
- ✅ Added support for all runner script variations:
  - `run-all-tests.sh` (brutal)
  - `run-edge-case-tests.sh` (edge-cases)
  - `run-ux-tests.sh` (user-experience)
  - `run-performance-tests.sh` (performance)
  - `run-security-tests.sh` (security)

## 📋 **Technical Implementation**

### **Master Runner Logic**
```bash
# Check for different possible runner script names
if [ -f "run-all-tests.sh" ]; then
    ./run-all-tests.sh
elif [ -f "run-edge-case-tests.sh" ]; then
    ./run-edge-case-tests.sh
elif [ -f "run-ux-tests.sh" ]; then
    ./run-ux-tests.sh
elif [ -f "run-performance-tests.sh" ]; then
    ./run-performance-tests.sh
elif [ -f "run-security-tests.sh" ]; then
    ./run-security-tests.sh
else
    echo "⚠️ No runner script found in $suite (continuing anyway)"
fi
```

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Objectives Achieved**
- ✅ All 5 test suites executed successfully
- ✅ Non-blocking execution maintained
- ✅ Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Clear output and status reporting
- ✅ Master orchestration working correctly

### **Quality Assurance**
- ✅ All test runners found and executed
- ✅ Consistent output formatting
- ✅ Proper directory navigation
- ✅ Error handling for missing scripts
