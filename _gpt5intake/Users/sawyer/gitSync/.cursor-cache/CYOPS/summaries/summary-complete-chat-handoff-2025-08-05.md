### MISSION OVERVIEW [ Agent, Phase, Status, Date ]
- Agent: DEV (CYOPS)
- Phase: Unified boot hardening + public tunnel restoration
- Status: IN PROGRESS — local services healthy; Cloudflare tunnel not active; public monitor failing (1033)
- Date: 2025-08-05

### CURRENT STATE & PROGRESS [ Completed Work, Next Patch Ready, Critical Technical Achievements, Current Task Status ]
- Completed technical work:
  - Removed body-parser usage; migrated to Express built-ins:
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/ghost-bridge.js`
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/ghost/ghost-relay.js`
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/server/index.js`
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/ghost-runner.js`
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/core/webhook-thoughtmarks-server.js`
  - Temporary hotfix to unblock runtime:
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/node_modules/depd/index.js`
  - Added missing components:
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/ghost/ghost-viewer.js`
    - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/utils/expoGuard.js`
  - PM2 ecosystem hardened for tunnel:
    - Absolute binary: `/opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared`
    - Args now include `--edge-ip-version 4`, `--credentials-file`, logfile, PATH env
    - App name: `cf-gpt-cursor-runner`
- Current local health:
  - Ports listening: 8787 (Flask dashboard), 8788 (telemetry-api), 8789 (telemetry-orchestrator), 5051 (ghost-bridge)
  - PM2 shows core services online (no flapping)
- Blocker:
  - Cloudflare tunnel `f1545c78-1a94-408f-ba6b-9c4223b4c2bf` has 0 active connections; tunnel logs show origin reach attempts via `[::1]:8787` (IPv6) getting refused; public URL `https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor` returns 1033

### CRITICAL REFERENCE FILES [ Completed Patches Location, Next Patch Location, Summary Files, Key Component Files ]
- PM2 config (updated): `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/config/ecosystem.config.js`
- Cloudflare config + creds + logs:
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/gpt-cursor-runner-config.yml` (ingress → `http://127.0.0.1:8787`)
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/f1545c78-1a94-408f-ba6b-9c4223b4c2bf.json`
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/gpt-cursor-runner.log` (tunnel log)
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/tunnel.info` (last tunnel info)
  - `/Users/sawyer/.cloudflared/log.tail` (recent tunnel log tail)
- Health and status outputs:
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/logs/pm2.status`
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/logs/pm2.status2`
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/logs/health.summary`
  - `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/logs/local8787.check`

### CURRENT DIRECTIVES & FOCUS [ Immediate Priority, Big Picture Goals, Quality Standards ]
- Immediate Priority:
  - Bring Cloudflare tunnel online (active connectors) and make public monitor return HTTP 200 at `https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor`.
- Big Picture Goals:
  - Unified boot stability (all PM2 services green, no flapping)
  - Public access healthy via Cloudflare tunnel; configured fallbacks ready
- Quality Standards:
  - Non-blocking terminal usage; absolute paths only; accurate summaries; no optimism until verified

### SAFETY GUIDERAILS & ENFORCEMENT [ Critical Rules (ZERO EXCEPTIONS), Patch Execution Requirements, File Management ]
- Absolute paths only under `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/`; no `~` or relative paths
- All potentially blocking commands must use: `{ timeout <N>s <command> & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`
- curl health checks must use subshell + PID capture + sleep + disown pattern
- Never use `git --force`
- Summaries must be written to: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries/` with `summary-` prefix
- No secrets in code; Slack domain is reserved for Slack; do not alter Slack routing

### WORKFLOW PATTERNS [ Standard Patch Execution Flow, Error Handling ]
- PM2 apply:
  - `{ timeout 30s pm2 startOrRestart /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/config/ecosystem.config.js & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`
- Health checks:
  - Write status to files (pm2/tunnel/ports), then read and report
- Public checks:
  - Use mandated curl-disown pattern; verify HTTP 200

### REMAINING PHASE PATCHES [ Immediate Next, Subsequent Patches Available ]
- Immediate Next:
  1) Ensure no stray cloudflared; restart PM2 `cf-gpt-cursor-runner` with IPv4-only and credentials-file (done). Re-verify.
  2) If still no connectors: launch cloudflared manually (absolute path, same args) using non-blocking pattern; re-check `tunnel info`.
  3) Verify `https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor` → HTTP 200.
  4) If still failing, temporarily route to fallbacks per user directive:
     - Secondary: `https://webhook-thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app`
     - Tertiary: `https://health.thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app`
- Subsequent:
  - Keep IPv4-only enforcement if logs continue to show `[::1]` access; confirm origin stays `http://127.0.0.1:8787` in config and runtime

### SUCCESS METRICS [ Completed Achievements, Next Success Criteria ]
- Completed Achievements:
  - Local services up; ports 8787/8788/8789/5051 listening; PM2 processes online
- Next Success Criteria:
  - `cloudflared tunnel info` shows ≥1 active connection
  - Public monitor returns HTTP 200
  - PM2 stable (no restarts flapping)

### CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT [ What NOT to Do, What TO Do, Key Technical Context ]
- Do NOT:
  - Block terminal; use relative paths; change Slack routing; reintroduce body-parser
- DO:
  - Maintain IPv4-only tunnel; keep origin `http://127.0.0.1:8787`; use `/opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared`
  - Continue using absolute non-blocking patterns; update this summary after each action

### LINKS / ENDPOINTS
- Primary: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/monitor`
- Fallbacks (user-approved):
  - `https://webhook-thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app`
  - `https://health.thoughtmarks.thoughtmarks.app`
