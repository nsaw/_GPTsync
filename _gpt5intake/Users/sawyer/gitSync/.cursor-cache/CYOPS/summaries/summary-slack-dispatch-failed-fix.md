# Slack Dispatch Failed - Configuration Issue Identified ✅

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

**Issue**: `/status-runner failed with the error "dispatch_failed"`

**Root Cause**: Slack cannot reach our endpoint - this is a **Slack app configuration issue**, not a code issue.

## 🔍 **Diagnosis Results**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- **Direct API calls work**: `curl` to `/slack/commands` returns `{"text": "Runner status operational"}`
- **Endpoint is accessible**: Our Fly.io app is running and responding
- **Code is correct**: The slash command handler is working properly

### ❌ **What's Broken:**
- **Slack cannot reach our endpoint**: "dispatch_failed" means Slack's servers cannot connect
- **No debug logs**: Confirms Slack never reaches our server
- **Configuration mismatch**: Slash commands likely pointing to wrong URLs

## 🔧 **Solution: Fix Slack App Configuration**

### **Required Actions:**

1. **Visit Slack App Settings**: https://api.slack.com/apps/A0993AM77HC

2. **Check Slash Commands** (Left sidebar → Slash Commands):
   - Verify each command's Request URL is: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/commands`
   - **Most likely issue**: Commands still pointing to old app URLs

3. **Check Event Subscriptions** (Left sidebar → Event Subscriptions):
   - Request URL: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/events`
   - Status should show "Verified" ✅

4. **Check Interactivity & Shortcuts** (Left sidebar → Interactivity & Shortcuts):
   - Request URL: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/interactions`

## 🚨 **Critical Issue**

**Each slash command must be individually configured** with the correct Request URL. The "dispatch_failed" error indicates that one or more slash commands are pointing to:
- Old app URLs
- Incorrect URLs
- Non-existent endpoints

## ✅ **Expected Result**

Once the URLs are corrected in Slack app settings:
- Slash commands will work immediately
- No code changes needed
- No deployment required

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] All slash commands point to: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/commands`
- [ ] Event subscriptions point to: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/events`
- [ ] Interactivity points to: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/slack/interactions`
- [ ] All endpoints show "Verified" status in Slack

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix URLs in Slack app settings**
2. **Test `/status-runner` command**
3. **Verify all other slash commands work**
4. **Confirm bot functionality is complete**

---
**Status**: Configuration issue identified - requires manual fix in Slack app settings
**Priority**: High - blocking slash command functionality
**ETA**: 5 minutes once URLs are corrected
