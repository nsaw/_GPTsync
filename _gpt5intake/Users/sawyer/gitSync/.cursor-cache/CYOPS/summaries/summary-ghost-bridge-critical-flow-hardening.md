- **Atomic Summary Creation**: Temp → final with backup verification
- **Stuck Patch Handling**: Automatic detection and movement to `.stuck/` directory
- **Queue Health Monitoring**: Real-time queue depth and stale patch detection
- **Log Write Failure Detection**: Fallback logging and critical alert creation
