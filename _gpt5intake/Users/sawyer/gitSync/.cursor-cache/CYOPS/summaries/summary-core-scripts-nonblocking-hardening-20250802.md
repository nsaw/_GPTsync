Status Messages:
- DEV: Implemented non-blocking, disowned execution with timeouts across core scripts. Added preflight port cleanup in boot, and dispatched post-boot PM2 introspection. All changes retain absolute paths and shell-safe patterns. Agent validation pending runtime.

Validation Summary: UNVERIFIED (no runtime executed in this change)

Edits (files and high-level impact):
- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-boot.sh
  - Added helpers: resolve_timeout_bin, nb(), curl_nb()
  - Wrapped pm2/curl/node starts in non-blocking subshells; disowned
  - Added preflight port cleanup (3001,3002,5001,5050,5054,7474,8789,3222)
  - Converted health checks to non-blocking dispatch; results go to unified-boot.log
  - Added post-boot PM2 status/log sampling and targeted restarts

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-manager.sh
  - Added nb()/curl_nb(); made health checks non-blocking
  - Restart tunnel and PM2 operations run via non-blocking wrappers
  - Status now dispatches checks to log while returning promptly

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-reboot.sh
  - Added nb()/curl_nb(); converted pm2/ports checks to non-blocking dispatch

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-shutdown.sh
  - Added nb(); pm2 stop/kill now non-blocking

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-status.sh
  - Reworked into a script that dispatches all status commands non-blocking; logs to unified-status.log

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/unified-test.sh
  - Added nb() helper for consistency (existing test runner already async-safe)

- /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/core/validate-all.sh
  - Added nb() helper (kept core validation synchronous to preserve exit codes)

Runtime/Health Notes:
- No commands executed here. At runtime, logs will write to:
  - /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-boot.log
  - /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager.log
  - /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-status.log

Agent validation: PENDING | USER/GPT VALIDATION NEEDED
