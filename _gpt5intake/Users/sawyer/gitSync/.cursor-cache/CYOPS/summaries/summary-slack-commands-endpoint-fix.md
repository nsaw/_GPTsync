# Summary: Slack Commands Endpoint Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-07 18:30 UTC  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Agent**: DEV (CYOPS)  

## Issue Identified
The Slack app manifest was pointing all commands to `/slack/commands` but the Flask app only had a `/slack/test` endpoint, causing 404 errors and "dispatch_failed" responses.

## Fix Implemented
✅ **Added `/slack/commands` endpoint** to `gpt_cursor_runner/main.py`:
- Created proper endpoint that handles Slack slash commands
- Extracts form data from Slack request
- Calls existing `handle_slack_command` function
- Sends response via `send_slack_response` if response_url provided
- Includes proper error handling and logging

## Current Status
- ✅ **Deployment completed** (version 122)
- ✅ **One machine started** (7814162c462698)
- ❌ **App not responding** to health checks or Slack commands
- ❌ **Need to investigate startup issues**

## Next Steps Required
1. **Check startup logs** to identify why app is not responding
2. **Verify all syntax errors are fixed** across the codebase
3. **Test Slack commands** once app is responsive
4. **Address the `assistant:write` scope warning** in Slack app manifest

## Technical Details
- **Slack App ID**: A0993AM77HC
- **Channel ID**: C0955JLTKJ4
- **App Name**: GHOST
- **Manifest Warning**: Line 148 - "Assistant:write scope should include assistant_view feature"

## Files Modified
- `gpt_cursor_runner/main.py` - Added `/slack/commands` endpoint

## Validation Needed
- [ ] App responds to health checks
- [ ] `/slack/commands` endpoint accepts POST requests
- [ ] Slack commands return proper responses instead of "dispatch_failed"
- [ ] All syntax errors resolved across codebase

**Agent validation**: PENDING - Awaiting app responsiveness confirmation
