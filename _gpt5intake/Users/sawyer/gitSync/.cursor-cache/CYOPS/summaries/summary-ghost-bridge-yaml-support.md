## 🎯 **Ghost Bridge YAML Support Implementation**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Target**: Enhanced `ghost-bridge-simple.js` with YAML patch detection  

---

## 📋 **Implementation Overview**

### **Core Enhancement**
Upgraded `scripts/ghost-bridge-simple.js` to support both JSON and YAML patch detection while maintaining backward compatibility and heartbeat functionality.

### **Key Features Added**
- ✅ **YAML Patch Detection**: Supports YAML format patches with `role: command_patch`
- ✅ **Dual Format Support**: Handles both JSON and YAML patches seamlessly
- ✅ **Enhanced Validation**: Improved patch structure validation
- ✅ **Flexible Routing**: Routes patches to MAIN/CYOPS based on target
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing JSON patch support
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite for YAML detection

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Functions**

#### **1. `extractCodeBlocks(content)`**
- Extracts both markdown code blocks (```...```) and inline code (`...`)
- Supports JSON and YAML code blocks
- Handles mixed content with multiple blocks

#### **2. `tryParseJSON(content)` & `tryParseYAML(content)`**
- Graceful parsing with null return on failure
- Uses `js-yaml` library for YAML parsing
- Maintains JSON parsing for backward compatibility

#### **3. `validatePatch(patch)`**
- Validates required `role: "command_patch"` field
- Checks for required `target` field
- Returns structured validation results

#### **4. `routePatch(patch, target)`**
- Routes to MAIN directory for `target: "MAIN"`
- Routes to CYOPS directory for `target: "CYOPS"` or `"DEV"`
- Defaults to CYOPS for unknown targets

#### **5. `processPatchBlock(block, source)`**
- Attempts JSON parsing first, then YAML
- Validates patch structure
- Routes to appropriate directory
- Generates standardized filenames

## 🧪 **Testing Implementation**

### **Test Script**: `scripts/test-yaml-patch-detection.js`

#### **Test Coverage**
1. **Code Block Extraction**: Tests markdown and inline code extraction
2. **Parse Functions**: Tests JSON and YAML parsing with error handling
3. **Validation**: Tests patch structure validation
4. **Routing**: Tests patch routing to correct directories
5. **Patch Processing**: Tests end-to-end patch processing
6. **Message Processing**: Tests mixed content processing

#### **Test Cases**
- ✅ Valid JSON patches
- ✅ Valid YAML patches (with comments)
- ✅ Invalid patches (missing role, wrong role, missing target)
- ✅ Mixed content processing
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## 📁 **File Structure**

```
scripts/
├── ghost-bridge-simple.js          # ✅ Enhanced with YAML support
├── test-yaml-patch-detection.js    # ✅ Comprehensive test suite
└── ghost-bridge-extractor.js       # ⚠️ Legacy (not used by unified manager)
```

---

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **JSON Patch (Existing)**
```json
{
  "role": "command_patch",
  "target": "CYOPS",
  "blockId": "test-json-patch",
  "version": "v1.0.0"
}
```

### **YAML Patch (New)**
```yaml
role: command_patch
target: MAIN
blockId: test-yaml-patch
version: v1.0.0
summary: Test YAML patch
```

### **YAML Patch with Comments**
```yaml
# This is a YAML patch
role: command_patch
target: DEV
blockId: test-yaml-comment-patch
version: v1.0.0
summary: Test YAML patch with comments
```

---

## 🔄 **Integration with Unified Manager**

### **Current Status**
- ✅ **Unified Manager**: Uses `ghost-bridge-simple.js` (enhanced)
- ✅ **PM2 Configuration**: Points to `ghost-bridge-simple.js`
- ✅ **Boot System**: Integrates with unified boot sequence
- ✅ **Heartbeat**: Maintains existing heartbeat functionality

### **Deployment**
The enhanced ghost bridge is automatically deployed through:
1. **PM2 Ecosystem**: `ecosystem.config.js` configuration
2. **Unified Boot**: `scripts/core/unified-boot.sh`
3. **Unified Manager**: `scripts/core/unified-manager.sh`
