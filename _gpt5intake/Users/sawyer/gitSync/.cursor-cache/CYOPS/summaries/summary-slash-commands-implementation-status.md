# Slash Commands Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-08-06 22:15 UTC  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Issue**: Commands returning "Unknown command" despite implementation

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Commands
- `/status-runner` - Returns "Runner status operational"

### ❌ Failing Commands  
- `/dashboard` - Returns "Unknown command: /dashboard"
- All other commands - Returning "Unknown command"

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that the updated `slack_handler.py` with comprehensive command implementations is not being used by the deployed application. The `/status-runner` command works because it was already implemented in the old version.

## Technical Details

### Deployment Status
- **Current Version**: 86 (deployed successfully)
- **Last Deployment**: 2025-08-06T22:01:50Z
- **Application**: Running and healthy

### Code Changes Made
1. **Enhanced `slack_handler.py`**:
   - Added comprehensive command handlers for all 20+ slash commands
   - Implemented `get_runner_status()`, `get_dashboard_url()`, `check_patch_status()` functions
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **Commands Implemented**:
   - `/status-runner` - Enhanced with system metrics
   - `/dashboard` - Returns dashboard URL with button
   - `/patch-pass`, `/patch-revert`, `/patch-preview` - Patch management
   - `/roadmap` - Project roadmap display
   - `/kill`, `/restart-runner` - Service control
   - `/cursor-mode`, `/toggle-runner` - Mode switching
   - And 15+ more commands

### Debugging Attempts
1. **Direct Testing**: Commands work when tested directly via curl
2. **Log Analysis**: No debug logs appearing for command processing
3. **Import Verification**: `handle_slack_command` is properly imported in `main.py`

## Next Steps Required

1. **Verify Code Deployment**: Ensure the updated `slack_handler.py` is actually deployed
2. **Check Import Path**: Verify the import is pointing to the correct file
3. **Add Debug Logging**: Add more verbose logging to trace command processing
4. **Test Individual Commands**: Test each command systematically

## Immediate Action Needed

The user should test `/dashboard` in Slack to confirm if the issue persists, and we need to add more debugging to understand why the new command handlers aren't being called.

**Agent Note**: All terminal commands must use non-blocking patterns: `{ command & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`
