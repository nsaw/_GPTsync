# ROADMAP GHOST2o -- DON'T START UNTIL YOU'VE READ THE WHOLE THING (VERIFICATION AND CORRECTIONS IN NEXT SECTION)

--- OVERVIEW ---<<<<<< MISSION: Evolve Ghost Runner → Cursor → Local for **full repo context** + **bi-directional live edits** >>>>>>

Here’s a fully built **G2o Roadmap** that merges the big-picture strategy with detailed patch-by-patch execution, validation rules, and audit logic — streamlined for operational clarity while preserving every refinement and logic layer we’ve discussed.

---

## **G2o: Ghost 2.0 Roadmap**

### **1. Strategic Overview**

Ghost 2.0 is not a rewrite — it’s an **infrastructure hardening and automation layer** designed to power the MAIN system (`tm-mobile-cursor`) reliably.
Core priorities:

* **Hardened Patch Infrastructure** → Hybrid patch execution with zero-trust validation.
* **Runtime Reliability** → Self-healing, non-blocking processes with watchdog monitoring.
* **Validation First** → Full static + runtime verification before marking any step complete.
* **Audit Transparency** → Triple-confirmation workflow with disk logs, console traces, and summaries.

---

## **2. Phase Structure & Goals**

| Phase  | Goal                                      | Core Deliverables                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1** | Base Infrastructure & Hybrid Patch Daemon | Build executor, Ghost bridge, routing, webhook    |
| **P2** | Role/Theming Enforcement                  | Enforce UI/UX standards from patch 1              |
| **P3** | Hardening Critical Patches                | Close validation gaps & system performance issues |
| **P4** | Feature Layer Integration                 | Content screens, performance hooks, app refresh   |
| **P5** | Testing & Validation Suite                | Unit tests, visual regression, performance tests  |
| **P6** | Optimization & Deployment                 | Render, memory, bundle, startup optimizations     |

---

## **3. Patch Execution Model**

Every patch must:

1. Follow **versioned naming** (`patch-v1.4.200(Px.xx.xx)_slug.json`)
2. Include **runtime safety controls** (`timeout 30s`, background exec, `watchConsole`)
3. Pass **static validation** before runtime:

   * `tsc --noEmit`
   * `eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings=0`
4. Trigger **runtime validation**:

   * Full app refresh
   * Boot Expo
   * Verify via `scripts/validate-runtime.sh`
5. Emit **summary + logs** to `/summaries` with:

   * Roadmap phase reference
   * Patch ID reference
   * Proof of validation steps executed

---

## **4. Validation Guidelines (Global Enforcement)**

* **Static**: TypeScript compile, ESLint clean, no warnings.
* **Runtime**: App boots without fatal errors, Expo responds on `:8081`, logs match expected.
* **Unit Tests**: Pass rate 100% on `yarn test:unit`.
* **Performance**: No regressions in render/memory usage.
* **Audit**: GPT verifies via disk logs + summary before patch marked complete.

---

## **5. Phase-by-Phase Patch List**

### **Phase 1: Base Infrastructure**

1. **Executor Core** — File routing, META store, retries, archive/dlq system.
2. **Ghost Bridge** — Webhook relay, patch queue handling, DLQ replays.
3. **Hybrid Patch Format** — JSON payload spec, validation plan embed.
4. **Safe Runtime Controls** — Timeout, disown, background execution defaults.

### **Phase 2: Role/Theming Enforcement**

* UI role enforcement layer
* Theming consistency: typography, spacing, color schemes locked into patch rules.

### **Phase 3: Hardening**

* **Gap Audit Patch**: Close 23 identified critical gaps (validation, memory, stability).
* **Performance Monitor Fix**: Stabilize frame render rate, reduce CPU spikes.
* **AutoRoleView**: Hardened and validated — final patch from this phase.

### **Phase 4: Feature Integration**

**Step 4.02 Content Screens:**

* `patch-v1.4.510` → Screen base scaffolding
* `patch-v1.4.511` → Data hooks integration
* `patch-v1.4.512` → UI bindings + console logs for validation
* `patch-v1.4.513` → Navigation wiring
* `patch-v1.4.514` → Styling + theme lock

**Step 4.03** → Follow-up 5 patches for secondary screens.

### **Phase 5: Testing**

* **5.01**: Unit tests across all new hooks/components.
* **5.02**: Visual regression baseline + snapshot diffs.
* **5.03**: Performance benchmark suite.

### **Phase 6: Optimization**

* **6.01**: Rendering optimizations
* **6.02**: Memory + bundle size reduction
* **6.03**: Startup + dual-mount speedup
* Accessibility and code quality audits

---

## **6. Audit & Reporting Model**

Every patch must be accompanied by:

* **Summary file** (no auto-generation by GPT — only executor or user)
* **Logs**: Full console and process output
* **Diff proof**: Before/after file comparisons
* **Validation results**: Static + runtime checks
* **Roadmap linkage**: 🔗 Patch-to-phase mapping

---

## **7. Big Picture**

G2o isn’t just a sequence of patches — it’s the **operational blueprint** for building a resilient automation backbone that MAIN can trust.
By Phase 6, Ghost 2.0 will:

* Self-heal patch failures
* Maintain airtight validation
* Operate with complete audit transparency
* Be capable of powering **continuous, verified delivery** to MAIN without human babysitting

        ```md
        ## A. Ingest: give me *continuous* read-only context

        **Goal:** I can “see” your repo + runtime status without touching your machine.

        * **Local Reporter (daemon):**

          * Watches repo paths you choose (e.g., `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/{tm-mobile-cursor,gpt-cursor-runner}`).
          * Emits every \~30–60s:

            * `manifest.json` (tree, sizes, mtime, git head, branch)
            * `hashes.json` (top-N large files + critical paths: src/, app/, config/, scripts/)
            * `status.json` (git status, dirty files, branch, unpushed commits)
            * `validation/*.json` (tsc/eslint/jest summary, lighthouse/perf if applicable)
            * `runtime/logs/*.log` tail excerpts (last 2–5 KB per stream)
        * **Publish** those artifacts to a **cloud-read** location I can fetch via web (read-only token or public link):

          * Option A: GitHub repo `nsaw/ghost-context` (readable; I don’t need write)
          * Option B: S3/GCS bucket with signed-URL index
          * Option C: Dropbox/Drive folder with direct-file links
        * **Privacy filters:** redact `.env`, secrets, PII, and any paths you exclude.

        > With that, I can *pull* your current state on demand and reason accurately.

        ## B. Command Queue: give you *safe write* via Cursor

        **Goal:** I generate patch JSON; your machine applies it, not me.

        * **Queue location (write by you / Ghost only):**

          * `ghost-queue/commands/` (cloud folder or GitHub repo)
          * Files: `patch-<ts>-<id>.json`, `hotfix-*.json`, `lint-*.json`
        * **Runner behavior:**

          * Polls `commands/` every 10–15s
          * Verifies HMAC signature + schema
          * Applies mutations through Cursor (or direct fs ops if allowed)
          * Emits `executions/<id>.json` with exit codes, diffs, and artifacts
          * Moves consumed command to `archive/`

        > Critical: I **don’t** need to POST to your machine (I can’t). Your runner **pulls** my commands from the queue you control.

        ## C. Feedback: close the loop with validation + logs

        **Goal:** I know if a patch worked and whether to send a hotpatch.

        * **Runner writes to cloud:**

          * `summaries/<id>.md` (human-readable)
          * `results/<id>.json` (structured: pass/fail per step, timings)
          * `logs/<id>-stdout.log`, `logs/<id>-stderr.log` (truncated)
          * `diffs/<id>.patch` (optional)
        * **I poll** those via the web (read-only) and respond with:

          * Next patch / hotpatch
          * Lint-only fix
          * Abort / rollback instruction

        ## D. Security model (non-negotiable)

        * **Least privilege PATs** (repo read-only for context; queue repo write for runner only).
        * **Verification:** All command files signed with **HMAC** + embedded nonce + expiry.
        * **Allowlist:** Runner only reads from your queue repo/bucket; never arbitrary URLs.
        * **Secrets hygiene:** `.env` never published. Summaries scrubbed by a sanitizer.
        * **Audit:** Append-only `audit.log` in context repo (who/what/when, content hashes).
        * **mTLS** if you add a push channel later; otherwise polling keeps the attack surface small.

        ## E. Slack & tunnels (reality check)

        * Slack is optional. If the Slack node is flaky, keep it out of the critical path.
        * Tunnels (Cloudflare/Ngrok) are **only** for dev convenience. Prefer polling from cloud storage for reliability + simplicity.
        * Fly shell has zero access to your *local* Mac unless you deliberately bridge it. Don’t rely on it.

        ---

        # 2) CI Tagging System (for my answers)

        I’ll attach a header/footer block on factual / reference answers:

        * **CI:** 0.00–1.00 numeric confidence (my internal estimate).
        * **Verify-tier:**

          * **V3 (Autoverified):** cites ≥2 reputable sources or uses your ground-truth files; low ambiguity.
          * **V2 (Check once):** cites ≥1 source or uses stable knowledge; moderate ambiguity.
          * **V1 (Verify):** no live source or high ambiguity; you should verify.
          * **V0 (Unknown):** I don’t know / needs research.
        * **Citations:** present/absent; if present, I’ll include them inline per section.
        * **Drift note (if applicable):** I’ll call out where my answer could be stale or risky.

        *(I’ll start using this immediately on answers that involve facts, status, or references.)*

        ---

        # 3) I added your TODO

        I set a reminder for **Monday, Aug 11, 2025 at 10:00 AM PT** to set up the cloud-based ruleset/reference directory that mirrors `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.
        Got it! I’ll remind you then.
        #DONE

        ---

        # 4) How to set up a **Custom GPT CLI Bridge** (minimal, safe, effective)

        ## Objectives

        * **Pull**: Give me continuous read-only repo + runtime context (Section 1A).
        * **Apply**: Consume patch commands from a queue and execute safely (Section 1B).
        * **Report**: Publish results/logs back (Section 1C).
        * **Secure**: HMAC, allowlists, redaction (Section 1D).

        ## Minimal spec (Node or Python)

        ### Endpoints/paths (cloud)

        * `context/manifest.json`, `context/status.json`, `context/hashes.json`
        * `validations/*.json`
        * `logs/*.log` (rotated/truncated)
        * `commands/*.json` (incoming patches)
        * `results/*.json`, `summaries/*.md`, `diffs/*.patch`, `executions/*.json`, `archive/*.json`

        ### Local services (on your Mac)

        1. **Reporter**

        * Watches repo roots; rebuilds context artifacts every 30–60s.
        * Runs `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `yarn test:unit` (or your scripts).
        * Redacts/separates secrets.
        * Pushes artifacts to cloud (Git push or S3 sync).

        2. **Executor**

        * Polls `commands/` → validates schema + HMAC + expiry.
        * Executes:

          * If patch targets Cursor: write hybrid block to the listening folder Cursor consumes (your existing `/tasks/patches`), or call Cursor’s CLI if you’ve exposed one.
          * If direct FS change: apply mutations via a safe writer that backs up, writes, and validates.
        * Runs **post-mutation validation** (your enforced pipeline: tsc, eslint, unit tests, runtime audit with Expo start/validate scripts).
        * Emits `results/*.json`, `summaries/*.md`, `logs/*`.

        3. **Sanitizer**

        * Scrubs `.md` summaries and `.log` files of secrets/paths before publish.

        ### Security

        * `.env.bridge` for tokens (never committed).
        * HMAC signature on every `commands/*.json`:

          * Include `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `nonce`, `hash(content)`.
        * Verify `schemaVersion` and `allowedActions`.
        * Rate-limit executor; queue depth guardrails; lock file to avoid concurrent stomps.

        ### Local install sketch (Node)

        * `pnpm i` (or yarn/npm) for:

          * `chokidar` (watch), `execa` (proc), `node-forge`/`jose` (HMAC), `isomorphic-git` (git ops), `fs-extra`, `zod` (schema)
        * `bridge.config.json`:

          * repoRoots, include/exclude, publishTarget (Git/S3), cadence, validationCommands, cursorPatchDir.

        ### Operational flow

        * `bridge start` → spawns reporter + executor
        * Reporter: publish `context/*` → cloud
        * I read `context/*` via web, craft `commands/*.json`
        * Executor: picks it up, applies, validates, publishes `results/*`, `summaries/*`
        * I read results, decide next step automatically (patch/hotfix/abort)

        > If you want, I can draft the exact folder tree + base `zod` schemas for `manifest.json`, `results.json`, `command.json`, and a reference `eslint/tsc/jest` runner. Just say “ship the schema set.”

        ---

        ## FAQ quick hits

        * **Can I POST/GET to your runner?** I can **GET** public artifacts for reading via web. I **cannot** reliably POST webhooks from here. That’s why the **polling queue** is the right design.
        * **Can you tail logs?** Not directly on your Mac. Yes, if your runner publishes rolling truncations to cloud and I poll them.
        * **Does Slack need to be in the loop?** No. It’s optional UI.
        * **Does Fly shell help?** Only for workloads *already on Fly*. It won’t reach into your Mac.

        ---

        ## What you’ll get out of this

        * I’ll operate with **live repo awareness** (manifests, hashes, status).
        * I’ll **auto-react** to validation failures with lint/hotpatch guidance.
        * You keep **hard security boundaries** (push-only queue, sanitized outputs).
        * The system is **recoverable** and **auditable** without fragile webhooks.

        ---

        **Next actions I recommend:**

        1. Approve the architecture above (A–E).
        2. Tell me to **“ship the schema set”** and I’ll give you:

           * `command.schema.json` (with HMAC fields)
           * `results.schema.json`, `manifest.schema.json`, `status.schema.json`
           * Reference `bridge.config.json`
        3. Choose **cloud target** (GitHub repo vs S3 vs Drive).
        4. I’ll generate a minimal **Node-based bridge** scaffold you can `pnpm start` today.

        ---

        **CI for this answer:** CI 0.88 • Verify-tier V1 (architecture; depends on your infra choices).
        Drift note: The POST limitation is a hard constraint of this interface; if tool capabilities change, we can reconsider a push model.```

## **G2o Roadmap — Streamlined Execution Plan**

    ### **Phase 0 — Foundations & Prep**

    **Goal:** Establish clean execution lanes, validation standards, and runtime safety before any patch.

    * **Steps:**

      1. **Baseline Audit** — Review existing bridge state, identify hard dependencies, and confirm all directories match expected (`_GPTsync/`, `meta/`, `commands/`).
      2. **Runtime Guard Rails** — Apply enforced settings (`autoReleaseTimeoutMs`, `watchConsole`, background execution).
      3. **Validation Hooks** — Bake in TS compile, ESLint, unit tests, runtime boot checks.
      4. **HMAC Secret Handling** — Set `GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET` in `.env` with strong random key.
    * **Validation Guidelines:** No commits until all preflight checks pass in one run.
    * **Audit Report Trigger:** Full folder hash + runtime screenshot + `meta/retries.json` integrity check.

---

### **Phase 1 — Command Path Reliability**

    **Goal:** Ensure `_GPTsync/commands` writes, retries, and dispatches are reliable.

    * **Patches:**

      1. **Write Path Monitor** — Persistent fs watcher to log all `.json` write events.
      2. **Retry Logic Audit** — Confirm `meta/retries.json` updates after every failed send.
      3. **Dead Letter Handling** — Automatic move of stale commands to `dead_letter/` with timestamp.
    * **Validation Guidelines:** Simulate 3 failed sends; confirm retries increment and DLQ archive created.
    * **Audit Report:** Command write timestamps vs. `results/` receipts.

---

### **Phase 2 — Ghost Dispatch & Response Loop**

**Goal:** Verify webhook→executor→results cycle is atomic and fault-tolerant.

* **Patches:**

  1. **Dispatch Verifier** — Payload HMAC validation before queue.
  2. **Executor Journal** — Append log per execution, include command ID + exit code.
  3. **Result Confirmation** — Results written and matched to originating command ID.
* **Validation Guidelines:** 10 command fire test; 100% must return matching results in under 30s.
* **Audit Report:** Command IDs, latency, errors, retries.

---

### **Phase 3 — Phase-Specific Functionality**

**Goal:** Modular patch deployment for bridge logic (e.g., hybrid patch handling).

* **Steps:**

  1. Hybrid patch parsing → queue
  2. Mutation proof generation
  3. Service uptime pre-check
* **Validation Guidelines:** Each patch runs end-to-end with logs, diffs, summaries, runtime verification.
* **Audit Report:** Mutation proof hashes + screenshot verification.

---

### **Phase 4 — Performance Hardening**

**Goal:** Reduce latency, improve fault recovery.

* **Patches:**

  * Async file writes with fsync
  * Parallel DLQ processing
  * Cache warm for executor imports
* **Validation:** Under 1s command enqueue latency under load.

---

### **Phase 5 — Continuous Audit & Self-Heal**

**Goal:** Bridge maintains itself in degraded states.

* **Features:**

  * Watchdog for executor hang
  * Auto-restart if meta or commands stall
  * Clock drift correction
* **Validation:** Force-kill executor, confirm restart and command recovery.

---

### **Global Validation Guidelines**

* ✅ All patches follow enforced runtime + validation rules
* ✅ CI tags with confidence + verify-tier + drift note
* ✅ No commit on error
* ✅ Disk proof > summary text

---

If you want, I can now **pull every step/patch from your `ghost3.0.md`** and map them into this G2o structure so it’s the *final execution-ready doc*.
Do you want me to do that next?

    
    
    Phase 0 — Preconditions (once) SEE HARDENING BELOW

    1. **Local clone of cloud queue/context repo**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /Users/sawyer/gitSync && cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync
    git clone git@github.com:nsaw/_GPTsync.git
    ```

    2. **Cursor listening inboxes (already present)**

    * MAIN:

      * patches → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`
      * summaries → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`&#x20;
    * CYOPS:

      * patches → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
      * summaries → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`&#x20;

    3. **Unified logs root (Reporter will tail from here)**
       `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/`&#x20;

    4. **Ports (for sanity checks only)**
       8787 Dashboard, 8788 Telemetry API, 8789 Telemetry Orchestrator, 8081 Expo, 4000 MAIN backend, 5051 Python Ghost Runner; 5555 reserved/not used. &#x20;

    # Phase 1 — Lay down the Bridge (Reporter + Executor)

    ## 1.1 Create bridge home + config

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    ```

    Create `bridge.config.json` (finalize paths before starting):

    ```json
    {
      "cloud": { "mode": "git", "repo_path": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync", "remote": "origin", "branch": "main" },
      "targets": {
        "MAIN": {
          "repo_root": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh",
          "patches_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches",
          "summaries_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries"
        },
        "CYOPS": {
          "repo_root": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner",
          "patches_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches",
          "summaries_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries"
        }
      },
      "context": {
        "roots": [
          "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh",
          "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner"
        ],
        "exclude_globs": [
          "**/node_modules/**","**/.git/**","**/.DS_Store","**/*.lock",
          "**/dist/**","**/build/**","**/.venv/**","**/.cursor-cache/**",
          "**/.logs/**","**/*.png","**/*.jpg","**/*.zip","**/*.tar.gz"
        ],
        "hash_globs": ["**/*.ts","**/*.tsx","**/*.js","**/*.json","**/*.sh","**/*.cjs","**/*.md"]
      },
      "cadence": { "context_seconds": 30, "commands_seconds": 15 },
      "security": { "hmac_secret_env": "GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET", "max_command_age_seconds": 300 }
    }
    ```

    ## 1.2 Expand Reporter log tails (match your real logs)

    Use these canonical files to start; adjust anytime:

    ```
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-boot.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager-watchdog.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/validation-tests.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/patch-events.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/tunnel-critical-failures.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/ghost-bridge.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/ghost-bridge-watchdog.log
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/pm2-list.txt
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/pm2-id-map.txt
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/ALLOW_PROCEED
    /Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/CRITICAL_ALERT
    ```

    (All live under the unified logs root you already use.)&#x20;

    ## 1.3 Per-target validation maps (config-driven)

    Put this into `bridge.config.json` (new top-level key):

    ```json
    "validation_map": {
      "MAIN": {
        "tsc": ["npx","tsc","--noEmit"],
        "eslint": ["npx","eslint",".","--ext",".ts,.tsx","--max-warnings=0"],
        "jest": ["yarn","test:unit","--watchAll=false"],
        "runtimeAudit": ["node","/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/validation/strict-runtime-validation.cjs"]
      },
      "CYOPS": {
        "tsc": ["npx","tsc","--noEmit"],
        "eslint": ["npx","eslint",".","--ext",".ts,.tsx","--max-warnings=0"],
        "jest": ["yarn","test:unit","--watchAll=false"]
        // no runtimeAudit for CYOPS unless you add one
      }
    }
    ```

    MAIN’s runtime audit path matches your validation wiring.&#x20;

    ## 1.4 Security secret (HMAC)

    ```bash
    export GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
    ```

    Persist it in your shell *and* in PM2 env (below).

    ## 1.5 PM2 supervise both daemons

    Ecosystem snippet (add to `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge/ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js`):

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      apps: [
        { name: "gpt-reporter", script: "./reporter.py", interpreter: "python3",
          max_restarts: 20, min_uptime: "10s", restart_delay: 5000 },
        { name: "gpt-executor", script: "./executor.py", interpreter: "python3",
          env: { GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET: "PASTE_LONG_SECRET" },
          max_restarts: 20, min_uptime: "10s", restart_delay: 5000 }
      ]
    };
    ```

    Start + persist:

    ```bash
    npm i -g pm2
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 save
    pm2 status
    ```

    Integrate in your **unified-manager** workflow right alongside the existing fleet.&#x20;

    # Phase 2 — Heavy hardening (11 TODOs with exact steps)

    ## 2.1 Secret/PII scrubber for published logs

    Add a scrub pass in Reporter before writing `runtime/tails.json`:

    * **Regexes**: AWS keys (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`), Slack tokens (`xox[baprs]-[0-9A-Za-z-]+`), JWT (`eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`), generic bearer tokens.
    * **Entropy cut**: if a token-like substring has >4.0 bits/char over ≥24 chars, replace with `"[REDACTED]"`.

    Keep a **redaction count** per file in the emitted JSON.

    ## 2.2 Git push lock + backoff (Reporter & Executor)

    Create `_GPTsync/.bridge.lock` file discipline:

    * Before commit: if lock exists and mtime < 120s → respect it; sleep with jitter (250–750ms), retry up to 12 times.
    * If free: create lock, run `git add/commit`, `git pull --rebase`, `git push`, then remove lock.
    * On push reject: wait **exponential backoff** (1s, 2s, 4s, cap 16s), retry pull+push up to 5 attempts.

    ## 2.3 Hard allowlist on write paths

    In Executor, when writing patch payloads:

    * Resolve `dst = realpath(patches_dir)/<file>.json`.
    * **Reject** if `dst` doesn’t start with `realpath(patches_dir)` (defends against `../` traversal).
    * Only allow write to `patches_dir` of the **target** agent specified by the command.

    ## 2.4 Clock skew & TTL

    On command ingest:

    * Ensure `issued_at <= now + 120s` and `now <= expires_at`.
    * Reject any file older than `max_command_age_seconds` (300s by config).

    ## 2.5 Retry + dead-letter

    * Track attempts in `executions/<id>.json` as `{attempts:n}`.
    * On transient failure, retry up to 3 times with backoff.
    * On final failure, move to `_GPTsync/dead-letter/<id>.json` with `{reason, last_log_pointer}`.

    ## 2.6 Backpressure / park-unpark

    * If file `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/CRITICAL_ALERT` exists, **Executor skips** new work (still pushes heartbeats).
    * Resume only when `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/ALLOW_PROCEED` exists or `CRITICAL_ALERT` disappears. (These files already exist in your logs tree.)&#x20;

    ## 2.7 Per-target validation in config (done above)

    Executor reads `validation_map[target]`. Any unknown step → reject command with `exit=1` and explanation.

    ## 2.8 Timeouts per step

    Add `validation_timeouts` to config:

    ```json
    "validation_timeouts": { "tsc": 180, "eslint": 240, "jest": 600, "runtimeAudit": 420 }
    ```

    Executor enforces per step. For cold Metro starts, 420s is sane.

    ## 2.9 Results integrity

    * After validations, compute SHA256 + size for each artifact you reference:
      `results/<id>.json` → `artifacts: { diffPatch: {...meta}, summaryMd: {...meta}, logsTail: {...meta}}`.
    * If an artifact missing → set `null` and include `missing: true`.

    ## 2.10 Offline push resilience

    * If `git push` fails (network), write pending commit SHAs to `_GPTsync/.pending-push`.
    * Next successful push sends them and clears the file. Limit to last 20 commits.

    ## 2.11 Sanity: expected vs actual changes

    * If `payload.inline` declares target paths, compare with `git diff --name-only`.
    * If mutated files drift outside declared scope by > N files (configurable), mark as **suspicious**, set `exit=1`, park command to dead-letter.

    ---

    # Phase 3 — Command schema + signing (operational)

    ## 3.1 Command JSON (drop into `_GPTsync/commands/`)

    ```json
    {
      "schemaVersion":"1.0",
      "id":"2025-08-08T21:07:00Z-abc123",
      "issued_at":"2025-08-08T21:07:00Z",
      "expires_at":"2025-08-08T21:12:00Z",
      "nonce":"1f2d3c4b",
      "target":"MAIN",
      "action":"applyPatch",
      "patchType":"hybrid",
      "payload":{"inline":{"version":"patch-vX.Y.Z","ops":[{"op":"noop"}]}},
      "validationPlan":["tsc","eslint","jest","runtimeAudit"],
      "allowedActions":["writeFile","moveFile"],
      "constraints":{"maxRuntimeMs":180000,"maxFilesChanged":50}
    }
    ```

    ## 3.2 Signing helper (one-liner)

    ```bash
    python3 /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge/sign_command.py < unsigned.json > signed.json
    ```

    (Include the HMAC in `signed.json`. Executor rejects unsiged/badsig/expired automatically.)

    ---

    # Phase 4 — Wire into **unified-boot** / **unified-manager**

    Add to `./scripts/core/unified-boot.sh` after the core fleet starts and before Slack stuff:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    export GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="YOUR_LONG_SECRET"
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 save
    ```

    In `unified-manager.sh`, treat them like 1st-class services:

    ```bash
    pm2 describe gpt-reporter >/dev/null 2>&1 || pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 describe gpt-executor >/dev/null 2>&1 || pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    ```

    (Your ops docs already tell folks to use the unified manager for everything, so this matches the pattern.) &#x20;

    ---

    # Phase 5 — E2E test (prove the loop)

    1. **Start daemons**:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js && pm2 save
    ```

    2. **Watch context publish** every \~30s to `_GPTsync/context/*` and `_GPTsync/runtime/tails.json`.
    3. **Drop a signed command** into `_GPTsync/commands/`.
    4. **Expect**: executor writes to MAIN (or CYOPS) `patches/`, runs plan, emits `results/<id>.json`, `diffs/<id>.patch`, archives the command, pushes.

    ---

    # Phase 6 — Ops runbook (reality happens)

    * **Queue parked?** Create `ALLOW_PROCEED`; delete `CRITICAL_ALERT`.
    * **Push failures?** Check for `.bridge.lock` and `.pending-push` in `_GPTsync`; clear if stale.
    * **Validation timeouts?** Tune `validation_timeouts`.
    * **High churn?** Increase `context_seconds` to 60–120s.
    * **Spam commands?** Enforce `maxFilesChanged` in constraints; add `requiredPaths` and reject drift.
    * **Tunnel death?** Shrug. Unused for control plane.

    ---

    # Phase 7 — Cloud ruleset/reference directory (optional but nice)

    Mirror your Cursor rules to `_GPTsync/rules/`:

    ```
    _GPTsync/
      rules/
        00-ground-truth.md
        10-validation-policy.md
        20-deployment-guardrails.md
        90-emergency-procedures.md
    ```

    Reporter can publish a `rules/index.json` with file hashes → I read them as part of context. (This mimics `.cursor/rules` you’re already using.)&#x20;

    ---

    # Phase 8 — Future edges

    * **Per-agent metrics:** publish `executions/index.json` with rolling stats (#success, #fail, mean durations).
    * **Command envelope encryption:** in addition to HMAC, PGP encrypt payload files if you want belt + suspenders.
    * **Split cloud targets:** `context/*` public-read; `commands/*` private (signed); `results/*` public.

    ---

    ## Grounding notes (paths & services)

    * Listener trees: `.cursor-cache/MAIN/*`, `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/*`.&#x20;
    * Unified logs set + signal files (`ALLOW_PROCEED`, `CRITICAL_ALERT`).&#x20;
    * PM2 fleet + ports + tunnels (reference only; not needed for control plane).  &#x20;
    * Intake bundle confirms these are the active working paths.&#x20;

    ---

    If you want, I’ll **package a hardened tar** with:

    * scrubber + lock + backoff + dead-letter + park/unpark
    * per-target validation from config
    * per-step timeouts
    * artifact integrity hashes

    Say the word and I’ll ship it ready to drop in `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge`.

    ---

    **CI:** 0.90 • **Verify-tier:** V2
    **Drift note:** Paths, logs, and roles pulled from your uploaded docs/trees; if your `_GPTsync` local path differs, change `cloud.repo_path` in `bridge.config.json`.



    ---


    Copy-pasteable **Cursor Playbook** to stand up the pull-based GPT Bridge (Reporter + Executor), wire it into your existing fleet, and validate the whole loop. I kept it surgical and path-correct to your trees.

    ---

    # 0) Read this first (prereqs)

    * **Local clone exists**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync` (remote: `github.com/nsaw/_GPTsync.git`)
    * **MAIN** (BRAUN) listeners:

      * patches → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`
      * summaries → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`
    * **CYOPS** (gpt-cursor-runner) listeners:

      * patches → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
      * summaries → `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`
    * **Install**: Node (for PM2), Python 3.10+, Git

    ```bash
    npm i -g pm2
    ```

    > Design reminder: **pull-only**. No tunnel dependency, no inbound POSTs. Bridge writes **context → \_GPTsync** and **pulls commands** from `_GPTsync/commands/`.

    ---

    # 1) Place the Bridge

    Choose a home (recommended): `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge`

    Option A — **Use the scaffold tar** I generated:

    1. Download: **gpt-bridge-scaffold.tar.gz** from our chat (you already have it).
    2. Unpack:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    tar -xzf ~/Downloads/gpt-bridge-scaffold.tar.gz
    ls -1
    # bridge.config.json.sample, reporter.py, executor.py, schemas.py, hmac_util.py, publish_github.py, ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    ```

    Option B — pull from `_gpt5intake/_meta/samples-scaffold` (your tree) and copy those files into `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge`.

    ---

    # 2) Configure the Bridge

    Create `bridge.config.json` from the sample, then edit:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    cp bridge.config.json.sample bridge.config.json
    open -a "Visual Studio Code" bridge.config.json
    ```

    Minimum fields (verify paths match your box):

    ```json
    {
      "cloud": {
        "mode": "git",
        "repo_path": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync",
        "remote": "origin",
        "branch": "main"
      },
      "targets": {
        "MAIN": {
          "repo_root": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh",
          "patches_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches",
          "summaries_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries"
        },
        "CYOPS": {
          "repo_root": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner",
          "patches_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches",
          "summaries_dir": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries"
        }
      },
      "context": {
        "roots": [
          "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh",
          "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner"
        ],
        "exclude_globs": [
          "**/node_modules/**","**/.git/**","**/.DS_Store","**/*.lock",
          "**/dist/**","**/build/**","**/.venv/**","**/.cursor-cache/**",
          "**/.logs/**","**/*.png","**/*.jpg","**/*.zip","**/*.tar.gz"
        ],
        "hash_globs": ["**/*.ts","**/*.tsx","**/*.js","**/*.json","**/*.sh","**/*.cjs","**/*.md"]
      },
      "cadence": { "context_seconds": 30, "commands_seconds": 15 },
      "security": { "hmac_secret_env": "GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET", "max_command_age_seconds": 300 }
    }
    ```

    ---

    # 3) Reporter: add the **right log tails** (your actual files)

    Edit `reporter.py`, update the `candidates` list to include the log files that truly exist on your box (from your unified log listing):

    ```python
    candidates = [
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-boot.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager-watchdog.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/unified-manager-watchdog-out-17.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/validation-tests.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/tunnel-critical-failures.log"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/ALLOW_PROCEED"),
        Path("/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/CRITICAL_ALERT")
    ]
    ```

    > You can add more tails anytime. They’ll appear in `_GPTsync/runtime/tails.json` (truncated to a few KB each).

    ---

    # 4) Executor: make the **validation plan** explicit

    Open `executor.py`. Find the `cmd_map` and adjust for your reality:

    ```python
    cmd_map = {
      "tsc": ["npx", "tsc", "--noEmit"],
      "eslint": ["npx", "eslint", ".", "--ext", ".ts,.tsx", "--max-warnings=0"],
      "jest": ["yarn", "test:unit", "--watchAll=false"],

      # MAIN runtime audit (mobile-native). Keep this as-is if you use the strict CJS.
      "runtimeAudit": ["node", "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/validation/strict-runtime-validation.cjs"]
    }
    ```

    If CYOPS uses a different audit command, we can split maps per target later; for now, keep audit on MAIN only and omit it for CYOPS in the command’s `validationPlan`.

    ---

    # 5) Secure the Bridge

    Set a **long random** HMAC secret for command signatures:

    ```bash
    export GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
    ```

    Persist it in your shell profile (or PM2 ecosystem env) so restarts keep it:

    * Edit `ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js` → in the `gpt-executor` app `env`, set `GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET: "<your-long-secret>"`.

    ---

    # 6) Start it under PM2

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 save
    pm2 status
    ```

    **Expected:**

    * `gpt-reporter` updates `_GPTsync/context/*` and `_GPTsync/runtime/tails.json` every \~30s (commits/pushes)
    * `gpt-executor` is idle, polling `_GPTsync/commands/` every \~15s

    ---

    # 7) Prove the loop with a **signed test command**

    Create a tiny signer to add the HMAC:

    `sign_command.py` (place next to the bridge files)

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import os, json, base64, hmac, hashlib, sys
    secret = os.environ.get("GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET") or "CHANGE_ME"
    cmd = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())  # JSON without "hmac"
    payload = json.dumps(cmd, separators=(",", ":"), sort_keys=True).encode("utf-8")
    mac = hmac.new(secret.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    cmd["hmac"] = base64.b64encode(mac).decode("ascii")
    print(json.dumps(cmd, indent=2))
    ```

    Generate a command (MAIN, 5-min expiry, **noop** payload):

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync/commands
    ID="test-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"

    cat <<JSON | GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="$GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET" python3 /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge/sign_command.py > $ID.json
    {
      "schemaVersion":"1.0",
      "id":"$ID",
      "issued_at":"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
      "expires_at":"$(date -u -v+5M +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
      "nonce":"$RANDOM",
      "target":"MAIN",
      "action":"applyPatch",
      "patchType":"hybrid",
      "payload":{"inline":{"version":"patch-vX.Y.Z","ops":[{"op":"noop"}]}},
      "validationPlan":["tsc","eslint","jest"],
      "allowedActions":["writeFile","moveFile"],
      "constraints":{"maxRuntimeMs":180000,"maxFilesChanged":50}
    }
    JSON
    ```

    **Watch:**

    * Executor writes a JSON into `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches/`
    * Runs tsc/eslint/jest in `repo_root` for MAIN
    * Emits into `_GPTsync/results/<id>.json`, `_GPTsync/diffs/<id>.patch`, `_GPTsync/archive/<id>.json`
    * Commits/pushes

    If you want runtime audit in this test, add `"runtimeAudit"` to the `validationPlan` (only if your `strict-runtime-validation.cjs` is ready and won’t hang; it’s long-running by nature).

    ---

    # 8) Wire into **unified-boot.sh** / **unified-manager.sh**

    In your boot script (after core fleet is up):

    ```bash
    # Start GPT Bridge (Reporter + Executor)
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    export GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="<your-long-secret>"
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 save
    ```

    In your manager/watchdog script, add **health checks**:

    ```bash
    pm2 describe gpt-reporter >/dev/null 2>&1 || pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 describe gpt-executor >/dev/null 2>&1 || pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js

    # Optionally park queue on CRITICAL_ALERT:
    if [ -f "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs/CRITICAL_ALERT" ]; then
      echo "CRITICAL ALERT detected, parking executor (no-op tick)"
      # Implement: touch / pause flag; or just skip processing in executor (future enhancement)
    fi
    ```

    ---

    # 9) Hardening (do these)

    * **PM2 stability** (already in the ecosystem file): `min_uptime: "10s"`, `max_restarts: 20`, `restart_delay: 5000`
    * **No infinite loops**: executor processes one command at a time; archive moved files; add backoff if >N failures in a row
    * **Git**: allow the “No changes to commit” path; it’s not an error
    * **Redaction**: reporter never publishes `.env`, secrets; tails are truncated
    * **Diff caps**: executor truncates patches > \~200 KB with a clear marker
    * **Allowlist**: executor only accepts `applyPatch` and only writes into your **known** listening directories

    ---

    # 10) Troubleshooting (quick cheats)

    * Nothing appears in `_GPTsync/context/`
      → `pm2 logs gpt-reporter`
      → ensure `cloud.repo_path` points to your local clone; check `git status` in `_GPTsync`; fix remotes; push works?

    * Command file ignored
      → Check it’s **JSON**, not expired, and signed: `badsig`, `invalid`, or `.badjson` files are moved to `_GPTsync/archive/`

    * Executor “Ran validations but nothing changed”
      → Expected on no-op patch; check results JSON & logs tail

    * ESLint/tsc hang
      → Re-run the commands manually in `repo_root` to repro; adjust timeouts in `executor.py` if needed

    * Crash loops
      → `pm2 logs --lines 200 gpt-executor`; adjust `restart_delay`, fix broken validation path; verify HMAC secret env exists

    ---

    # 11) Maintenance

    * You can add/remove log tail files in `reporter.py` any time.
    * If CYOPS needs a different `runtimeAudit`, duplicate `cmd_map` per target (or move it to `bridge.config.json` if you want it data-driven).
    * When you add new validations, just include them in the `validationPlan` array and expand `cmd_map`.

    ---

    # 12) What do you want me to ship next?

    * **“Ship the updated tar.”** → I’ll regenerate with:

      * Expanded `reporter.py` tails (the exact files you’re logging now)
      * Config-driven validation maps per target (MAIN vs CYOPS)
      * Optional queue park/unpark using `ALLOW_PROCEED` / `CRITICAL_ALERT` files

    Or if you’re ready, we can jump straight to **live commands** and start exercising the loop.

    ---

    **CI:** 0.90 • **Verify-tier:** V2
    **Drift note:** Paths/log names pulled from your trees and unified logs listing; if your `_GPTsync` local clone path differs, update `cloud.repo_path` in `bridge.config.json`.


---



# Verified: patch inboxes, summaries, logs (from your files)

    * **MAIN patch inbox & summaries exist** at:

      * `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`, `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`.  &#x20;
        (You’ve also got `ui-patch-inbox`, `validation`, `scripts`, etc., under MAIN.)&#x20;
    * **CYOPS patch inbox & summaries exist** at:

      * `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`, `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`. &#x20;
        (Lots of CYOPS folders: `config`, `queue`, `logs`, `validation`, etc.)&#x20;
    * **ROOT log hub exists** at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs` with many concrete log files (`validation.log`, `patch-executor*.log`, `unified-boot.log`, etc.). That directory’s confirmed and populated.&#x20;
    * **Live operational logs** also show heavy activity under CYOPS’ patch logs (e.g., `unified-manager.log`, `daemon-watchdog.log`, etc.), which are great candidates for 2–5KB tails. &#x20;
    * Your `gitSync` snapshot includes the `gpt-cursor-runner` project with `scripts/core` present (so the bridge can treat that repo as the CYOPS target by default).&#x20;

    If you want me to point tails at any *additional* files beyond the defaults, tell me which to include. Otherwise, I’ll tail the ROOT hub plus a few hot CYOPS patch logs (bounded + scrubbed).

# Hardened Ghost Bridge — ready to drop

I built a **PM2-managed, Python-first** Ghost Bridge with:

* **Scrubber** (redacts secrets in tails/artifacts)
* **Single-instance lock** (no double-runs)
* **Exponential backoff + jitter** (no CPU storm)
* **Dead-letter queue** after N retries (persisted to cloud repo)
* **Park/Unpark** via `CRITICAL_ALERT` / `ALLOW_PROCEED` sentinels in ROOT logs
* **Per-target validation from config** (MAIN vs CYOPS), **per-step timeouts**
* **Artifact integrity hashes** (SHA256)
* **Git publisher** (add/commit/push with empty-commit avoidance)

**Download:**
[ghost-bridge-hardened.tar.gz](sandbox:/mnt/data/ghost-bridge-hardened.tar.gz)

It contains:

* `reporter.py`, `executor.py`
* `lib/` (locks, redaction, backoff, HMAC, schemas, runners)
* `publish_github.py`
* `bridge.config.json.sample` (pre-filled for your paths)
* `ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js`
* `README.md`

---

# Install (step-by-step, start→finish)

    ## 0) Prereqs (once)

    * Ensure your cloud repo is locally cloned (adjust if your path differs):

      ```
      git clone git@github.com:nsaw/_GPTsync.git /Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync
      ```
    * Have PM2 available:

      ```
      npm i -g pm2
      ```

    ## 1) Drop in the bridge and configure

    ```
    mkdir -p /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync
    # Move/untar the archive here, so the folder is /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    ```

    Then:

    ```
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    cp bridge.config.json.sample bridge.config.json
    ```

    Open `bridge.config.json` and confirm/tweak:

    * **Cloud repo path:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_GPTsync`
    * **Targets**

      * MAIN

        * `patch_inbox`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`&#x20;
        * `summaries`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`&#x20;
        * `repo_root`: **your MAIN code repo** (defaults to `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor`; change if needed)
        * `validations`: edit commands/timeouts to match your scripts
      * CYOPS

        * `patch_inbox`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`&#x20;
        * `summaries`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`&#x20;
        * `repo_root`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner`
    * **Logs**

      * `paths.logs_root`: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs`&#x20;
    * **Tails**: prefilled with ROOT hub logs; add/remove any specific log files you care about (all tails are scrubbed + bounded).
    * **Retry policy**: defaults `max_retries=3`, backoff base 2s, max 60s.
    * **Max diff**: defaults to \~200KB.

    ## 2) Run it under PM2

    ```
    cd /Users/sawyer/gitSync/ghost-bridge
    export GPT_BRIDGE_HMAC_SECRET="<long-random-secret>"
    pm2 start ecosystem.gpt-bridge.config.js
    pm2 save
    pm2 status
    ```

    ## 3) Sanity-check loop

    * In `_GPTsync/` you should see **context** and **runtime/tails.json** updating every \~30s.
    * No tunnels required. If Fly/CF/ngrok fall over, this keeps running.

    ## 4) End-to-end test (one command)

    Create a signed command for **MAIN** and drop it in `_GPTsync/commands/`. If you want a helper signer, use the small script I gave earlier (or ping me to include it in the bundle). The executor will:

    * Verify HMAC/expiry → write patch JSON into MAIN’s **patch inbox**
    * Run configured **validations** with **timeouts**
    * Emit `results/<id>.json`, `diffs/<id>.patch` (bounded), integrity JSON
    * **Archive** the command (or **dead\_letter/** if it fails too many times)
    * Commit & push

    ---

    # How this maps to your logs & layout (so you know it’s aligned)

    * MAIN inbox/summaries/validation dirs are exactly where your cache shows them. &#x20;
    * CYOPS inbox/summaries exist and are busy; we tail a couple of those hot logs too. &#x20;
    * ROOT log hub exists and is the right focal point for global health (we read tails from there first).&#x20;
    * `gpt-cursor-runner` repo is on disk and structured as expected (so CYOPS `repo_root` default is sane).&#x20;

    ---

    # What’s included in the hardening

    * **Scrubber**: regex redaction for likely secrets in tails/artifacts before pushing to cloud.
    * **Lock**: `/tmp/ghost_reporter.lock` and `/tmp/ghost_executor.lock` (flock).
    * **Backoff**: exponential + jitter on executor loop errors.
    * **Dead-letter**: after `max_retries`, command goes to `_GPTsync/dead_letter/` and we push a commit for visibility.
    * **Park/Unpark**: if `CRITICAL_ALERT` exists in ROOT logs dir, the executor pauses; create `ALLOW_PROCEED` to resume (both file paths are configurable).
    * **Per-target validations**: driven by `bridge.config.json` so MAIN vs CYOPS can diverge safely. Each step runs with its own timeout and returns structured exit/stdout/stderr.
    * **Integrity**: SHA256s for results/diff recorded per execution.

    ---

    # Next knobs (if you want me to bake them in):

    * Add/adjust specific tail files (the list is in `bridge.config.json`; I can widen it to include any log from your long CYOPS `.logs/` list).&#x20;
    * Tweak validation plans per target (e.g., add `ultra-runtime-validation.sh` for MAIN or a lighter plan for CYOPS).
    * Flip the manifest roots to include any other code repos you want me to “see” for context.

    Say the word and I’ll ship an **updated tar** with those tweaks pre-baked.

    ---

    **CI:** 0.86 • **Verify-tier:** V2
    (Dirs & logs verified from your uploaded trees/listings; the only assumption is the local clone path for `_GPTsync`—if yours differs, edit `bridge.config.json → cloud.repo_path` and you’re golden.)

















-------------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

# Coverage map (yours → mine)

    ## Core loop

    * **Pull-only architecture (no inbound POSTs/tunnels required)** → **Covered.** Reporter publishes `context/*, runtime/tails.json`; Executor polls `_GPTsync/commands`, applies patches to Cursor inboxes, runs validations, writes `results/* + diffs/* + archive/*`.
    * **Two-way comms via cloud repo** (you push logs/results, I queue commands) → **Covered.**
    * **Slack optional** → **Covered.** Not in critical path.
    * **Fly/Cloudflare/ngrok instability** → **Neutralized.** Not required for command/control.

    ## “Reporter” (what you were missing)

    * **manifest/status/hashes** → **Covered** (30s cadence, capped entries).
    * **validation snapshots** (lightweight heartbeat) → **Covered** (runtime heartbeat; heavy checks live in Executor).
    * **bounded log tails** → **Covered**, and you can extend the candidate list to match MAIN/ROOT logs you pointed me to.
    * **no secrets** in outputs → **Partially covered:** path/filename excludes; we should add an entropy-based content scrubber (see TODOs).

    ## Executor

    * **HMAC + nonce + expiry** on command files → **Covered.**
    * **Allow-listed actions + schemaVersion** → **Covered** (basic).
    * **Cursor inbox write** (MAIN/CYOPS) → **Covered** exactly per your paths.
    * **Validations** (tsc/eslint/jest + runtimeAudit for MAIN) → **Covered**; mapping is in code today (we can externalize to config per-target).
    * **Structured diffs per exec** → **Covered** (size-capped, truncates with marker).
    * **Archival** (commands → archive) → **Covered.**

    ## Orchestration / Reliability

    * **PM2-managed daemons** for both Reporter & Executor → **Covered.**
    * **Restart guardrails** (`min_uptime`, `max_restarts`, `restart_delay`) → **Covered.**
    * **No cron/launchd storm** → **Covered by using PM2** and single-instance processes.

    ---

    # Gaps & TODOs (I recommend we ship these next)

    1. **Secret/PII scrubbing (content-level)**

       * Today: we exclude obvious paths.
       * TODO: add a high-entropy and pattern-based scrub pass on log tails and summaries before publish (tokens, keys, AWS creds).

    2. **Git publish race/lock** (Reporter & Executor both push `_GPTsync`)

       * Today: simple `pull --rebase` before push.
       * TODO: add a tiny file lock in `_GPTsync/.bridge.lock` or serialize pushes (Executor only, Reporter batches), with exponential backoff on remote rejects.

    3. **Executor allowlist enforcement (hard)**

       * Today: we *intend* to write only to configured “listening\_dir”, but it’s not a hard jail.
       * TODO: assert the destination path **starts with** the configured inbox dir; reject any traversal or cross-target writes.

    4. **Clock skew & TTL**

       * Today: we enforce `expires_at`.
       * TODO: enforce `issued_at` within ±5 min and reject stale/future-dated commands beyond skew.

    5. **Dead-letter & retry policy**

       * Today: one attempt; archive with suffix on failure (`.invalid`, `.badsig`, etc.).
       * TODO: add retry ≤ N with backoff, then move to `_GPTsync/dead-letter/`.

    6. **Queue backpressure / flood control**

       * Today: executor grabs oldest first.
       * TODO: cap concurrent work to 1; park queue if `CRITICAL_ALERT` exists; auto-resume on `ALLOW_PROCEED`.

    7. **Validation map per target in config**

       * Today: hard-coded `cmd_map`.
       * TODO: move to `bridge.config.json`, add separate MAIN/CYOPS maps (so CYOPS can skip runtimeAudit entirely, MAIN keeps strict).

    8. **Timeout tuning for long audits**

       * Today: generic timeouts (120–180s).
       * TODO: per-step timeouts in config (runtimeAudit often needs >180s on cold Metro start).

    9. **Results integrity**

       * Today: we write `summaryMd` path optimistically.
       * TODO: check existence; set `null` if missing; include sizes + SHA256 for artifacts.

    10. **Offline push resilience**

    * Today: push attempts every tick; on failure, we try again next loop.
    * TODO: exponential backoff + local queue of pending commits to avoid hammering when offline.

    11. **Sanity “diff expected vs actual files changed”**

    * Today: create diff and move on.
    * TODO: ensure files mutated match patch target expectations (nice guard against unexpected blasts).

    If you want, I’ll **ship an updated tar** with all 1–11 baked in plus your expanded log tails and per-target validation config. (Your call.)

    ---

    # Does this cover your earlier bullets?

    * **Tunnel-first runner?** We sidestep it. Covered via pull-plane.
    * **Webhook executor present?** Yours stays; ours writes to its inbox. Covered.
    * **Watchdog/log writers present?** Yup; we consume them as tails. Covered.
    * **Health endpoints?** Nice-to-have; not required anymore. Covered/optional.
    * **Diff artifacts missing?** Now covered.
    * **Reporter missing?** Now covered.
    * **PM2 vs systemd vs cron?** We standardized on PM2 locally (your pain point). Covered.
    * **Trailed logs?** We publish small tails; I read them. Covered.
    * **Live file access?** Achieved via manifests/hashes + diffs, safely, no raw FS scrape. Covered.

    So: **Yes**—the playbook + scaffold handle the whole shape you pasted, **minus** the hardening bullets above (which I can roll in next if you want one more turn of the crank).

    ---

    Want me to **ship the updated tar** with those 11 hardening items + your exact MAIN/ROOT log set + per-target validation in config? If yes, say: **“Ship hardened tar.”** I’ll hand you the file and a one-liner to swap it in.

    ---

    **CI:** 0.91 • **Verify-tier:** V2
    **Drift note:** Aligned to your tar/docs and `_GPTsync` tree you pointed at. If any local paths differ, update `bridge.config.json → cloud.repo_path` and the log-tail candidate list.

    ---


    Alright, first I’ll **verify your paths & logs** from the files you gave me, then I’ll hand you a **ready-to-drop hardened bridge tarball** with all the goodies (scrubber, lock, backoff, DLQ, park/unpark, per-target validation, timeouts, integrity hashes).

    # Verified: patch inboxes, summaries, logs (from your files)

    * **MAIN patch inbox & summaries exist** at:

      * `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches`, `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`.  &#x20;
        (You’ve also got `ui-patch-inbox`, `validation`, `scripts`, etc., under MAIN.)&#x20;
    * **CYOPS patch inbox & summaries exist** at:

      * `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`, `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`. &#x20;
        (Lots of CYOPS folders: `config`, `queue`, `logs`, `validation`, etc.)&#x20;
    * **ROOT log hub exists** at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/ROOT/.logs` with many concrete log files (`validation.log`, `patch-executor*.log`, `unified-boot.log`, etc.). That directory’s confirmed and populated.&#x20;
    * **Live operational logs** also show heavy activity under CYOPS’ patch logs (e.g., `unified-manager.log`, `daemon-watchdog.log`, etc.), which are great candidates for 2–5KB tails. &#x20;
    * Your `gitSync` snapshot includes the `gpt-cursor-runner` project with `scripts/core` present (so the bridge can treat that repo as the CYOPS target by default).&#x20;

    If you want me to point tails at any *additional* files beyond the defaults, tell me which to include. Otherwise, I’ll tail the ROOT hub plus a few hot CYOPS patch logs (bounded + scrubbed).

# GPT IS CURRENTLY BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING CONSTRAINTS:
    ```
        1. Scope of My Access (Now)
        I cannot look into your “science project” folder or any live local directory unless you explicitly upload files here, give me a link to cloud-hosted copies, or set up a custom API/bridge to feed them to me.

        I cannot run grep across your actual hard drive. I can grep across:

        Uploaded archives (.zip, .tar.gz)

        GitHub repos you give me access to (if they’re public or you paste the raw file tree)

        Files already present in this chat session’s sandbox

        The persistent “memory” of our CYOPS / GPT-Cursor-Runner conversations is in my stored instructions — not searchable live. But I can reconstruct the architecture from those stored directives and past chat logs in this thread.

        2. Ghost Runner + Webhook Feasibility
        Current model: You → me → I generate hybrid patch JSON → Ghost Webhook → Cursor → executes on your local machine.

        This is feasible because the webhook is an API endpoint that your local Ghost Runner listens to. I don’t need direct filesystem access — I send the payload, Ghost Runner does the writing and execution.

        If your Slack node in that chain is down? No problem if Ghost Runner is still up — we can skip Slack entirely (we’ve done that per your July 10th rule #20).

        Two-way communication: The Ghost Bridge only allows two-way if the Ghost Runner is coded to send its logs/summaries back to me (via webhook, API, or file feed). It’s not automatic — it’s architectural.

        3. Log Tailing
        Direct tailing of your actual live logs? No — I can’t just tail -f /var/log/... on your real machine without a bridge process sending me updates.

        Simulated tailing: If Ghost Runner pushes log lines to a webhook or writes them to a cloud-synced location I can read from, I can monitor them in near real time.

        That’s how we do “watchdog” mode in the CREW MANIFEST — Ghost Runner writes .md summaries or .log files to /summaries/, and I re-parse every 30s.

        4. Fly.io & Tunnels
        Fly shell access: Lets me run commands inside your deployed container/app — not your local machine — unless you’ve deployed your local environment into Fly as a container.

        Cloudflare/Ngrok tunnels: These can expose parts of your local machine to the internet, but I can’t use them without:

        The tunnel actively running

        You giving me the tunnel URL

        A server process on your machine set up to respond to my requests

        That’s basically how Ghost Runner works — it’s your local bridge exposed through a tunnel.

        5. Expanding My Live Access
        Here’s the realistic capability ladder:

        Method    What it Gives Me    Security Trade-off
        File upload in chat    Exact files/folders you choose    Totally safe, but manual
        GitHub/GitLab repo link    Read access to repo state (public or with token)    Safe if read-only; write requires token
        Ghost Runner webhook    Can send patch instructions that your machine executes    No read access unless Ghost Runner sends data back
        Tunnel + API server    Potentially full read/write in exposed dirs    Dangerous if unsecured
        Custom GPT CLI bridge    Persistent two-way file & command sync    Very powerful but requires you to install & run it — high trust needed

        6. Things I Cannot Do (Even With Permissions)
        Install software on your machine without you running the commands

        Keep a persistent, OS-level “agent” running without your explicit setup

        Break isolation and scan your drive uninvited — I have no silent channel to your system

        7. Yes, You Could Give Me More
        If you want me to have live repo awareness, here’s how:

        Run a GPT CLI bridge — could be a Node/Python app that:

        Watches your local files for changes

        Pushes diffs to me via webhook

        Accepts my commands to edit files

        Expose .env/.config rules via Git or cloud — I can read and respect these like .cursor/rules/ if they’re in a cloud folder I can fetch from.

        Cloud sync repo snapshot — Google Drive, Dropbox, or even GitHub private repo — lets me do static analysis and then push patch instructions.

        8. Memory Expansion via Cloud
        Yes — you could maintain a cloud-based master ruleset in .mdc format.

        If that’s public or accessible via a token, I can pull it at the start of every session.

        This would give us “persistent brain” behavior beyond what OpenAI’s own memory system holds.

        Cursor already uses .cursor/rules/ — we could mirror that concept in a shared Drive folder I read each time.

        9. The Real Limitations That Don’t Change
        I can’t run unsupervised 24/7 in your environment — all persistence depends on your side keeping a process alive.

        I can’t access arbitrary local files unless you route them to me.

        I can’t install myself into your OS — only tools you run can act as my bridge.

        Blunt Truth:
        If you want “GPT as your local co-pilot with repo-wide live state,” you need a custom bridge process on your machine or in your cloud that:

        Feeds me your current files/logs/rules

        Receives my patch instructions

        Applies them locally or in Cursor
        That’s the only way to get real-time, repo-aware, two-way automation.``` 
        
        
        
        
## Here’s the no-BS blueprint + the guardrails.
